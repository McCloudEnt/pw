 RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "For almost two decades it was believed that the United States and Soviet Union would be at each other's throats for a century to come. But with an economic crisis every few years, a socialist revolution in another third world nation and a disastrous American intervention somewhere on the planet, the United States collapsed in 1987. As the Soviet Union took control over the world and the lands of the former United States shattered into various nations, it seemed that communism was unstoppable. But now as the Soviet world order weakens, can democracy be revived? Or will a more radical ideology take hold?"
 SOV_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is the dominant power in the world. Its influence stretches across all continents, and many nations depend on its protection. But since the rise of Dmitry Yazov to the position of general secretary in 1996, the country’s power has been waning. The nations of Europe increasingly look to Germany for guidance while the Soviet economy has grown stagnant and corrupt, and many have begun to question the future of the socialist project. With enemies both within and without, can the communist world order be saved?"
 PRC_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The People's Republic of China is in a difficult position. While communism is the dominant ideology of the world, the PRC broke with the USSR in 1977 after Mao Zedong’s death. Now China is isolated, with decades of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution having taken its toll on the country’s economy and people. Recognizing the need for reform, China’s leadership has begun a slow and measured opening of the country. But such an opening also means an opportunity for external influences to enter the country, and many question whether China can survive such a radical shift."
 GER_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "After being divided for nearly four decades, the two German states reunited in 1985 with much fanfare. Four years later Austria also joined the republic, now the dominant power in central Europe. Since then, the German Democratic Republic has maintained a strong military and economy, as well as a stable political system. As the strongest country in the European Union of Socialist Republics, many are beginning to suspect that Germany has become more powerful than the Soviet Union itself, influencing its European neighbors for its own gains. Could Germany become the successor to the fading Soviet world order?"
 PCA_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The Union of American People's Republics was established during the catastrophic collapse of the United States, as loyal communists and supporters of the Soviet leadership fled west to create a new America based on their vision. Unofficially allied with the USSR, the UAPR is the internationally recognized successor to the United States of America, but has experienced internal tensions since the beginning. The economy never really managed to recover from the great collapse and the northern Columbian People’s Republic has been a hotbed of separatism. Should the Soviet world order fall there will be few friends for the nation to turn to."
 NEA_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The American People's Commonwealth is a nation of communists who have no loyalty to the Soviet Union, condemning it as a fascist abomination. When the United States collapsed, these like-minded activists secured control over the Northeast in what they called the Second American Revolution. Inheriting the industrial heartland of New England and the Midwest, the APC is the most economically powerful nation in the former US, but it suffers from a lack of international recognition, foreign trade and a gridlocked political system. Can this unusual enemy of the USSR get itself back on its feet before either the Soviets or the Remnants take it all away?"
 USA_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The American Republic, or as it is more commonly known around the world, the Remnants, is considered by many to be the true successor to the United States. When President Ronald Reagan resigned and dissolved the US, Vice President George Bush seized control of Washington D.C. and ordered all loyal patriots to flee south, proceeding to shut the city off from the rest of the world like West Berlin. Ruling until his death in 2001, Bush was succeeded by Donald Rumsfeld, who saw the republic stabilize and regain some measure of international standing. Now the republic seems poised to retake what they have lost, or perish in the attempt."
 ENG_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom is seen by many as the last bastion of democracy in Europe. In lengthy talks with the Irish government, both sides agreed in 1984 to put aside their differences and create a unity government in Northern Ireland, allowing Britain to divert its political power to halting the revolution. In the decades since, tensions in the Kingdom are boiling over, with Prime Minister David Owen seen as a threat to the survival of the European Union and the Soviet world order. Will the United Kingdom continue on its path of isolation and stability, or will a strong leader take charge?"
 OTHER_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Only a ten years into the new millenium, storm clouds are brewing. As the final battle between communism and its greatest enemies draws near, every nation has the opportunity to chart its path and decide what the future will hold for it in the 21st century."
 ETH_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Ethiopia is the Warsaw Pact’s closest ally in Africa. Though lauded as a rising power on the continent, the situation is far from ideal. Separatism plagues Eritrea and reports of an incoming famine have thrown the nation into a panic. Spurned by these grim rumors, the government has descended into infighting between party loyalists, anti-Soviet dissidents and the Derg, Ethiopia’s powerful military clique. Each faction presents themselves as the solution to the crisis but their division may be the undoing of the entire socialist regime. Will the Ethiopian revolution survive or has the time come to forge a new destiny?"
 ITA_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The Italian Union is the shining Red Jewel of the Mediterranean, a beacon of socialist prosperity in a time when the red star of Moscow is waning. With the establishment of Communist rule in 1984, when Enrico Berlinguer formed a coalition with the Socialist Party, the country has put the violent Years of Lead behind it. Today, Italy is a peaceful society, and although the problems with the Mafia represents some issues, this peace generally reigns undisturbed. However, storm clouds are gathering on the horizon, and time will tell whether the Socialist Revolution can hold together in the 21st century."
 UAR_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Fifty-two years after its founding, the future of the United Arab Republic is uncertain. While Nasser’s successors have maintained stability and overseen unprecedented economic growth, cracks are showing in the facade of Arab unity. The failure to unite much of the Arab world in 1992 brought the political and economic imbalance in favor of Egypt to the forefront. The influential Assad family, fearing any threat to their grip on power in Syria, has stifled all attempts at correcting the situation. As the divide between Damascus and Cairo widens by the day, it would not take much for the union Nasser founded half a century ago to be swept away."
 YEM_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Marred by destruction and division, Yemen is a scarred country. First brought together by the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, the country split once again in the first years of the 21st century. With aid from Donald Rumsfeld's American Republic, the northern Yemen Arab Republic managed to defeat their southern rivals and reunite the country. Although ejected from Aden, the socialists remain in control of much of the eastern hinterlands, poised to strike back and regain power. With government authority becoming increasingly fragile, many wonder if Yemen will once more be torn apart."
 RAJ_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The Republic of India is the world’s largest democracy and an emerging power in Asia. Practicing its own unique form of socialism, the country now finds itself outside the international political system built by its old ally, the Soviet Union. Economic growth has been slow, with harsh licensing restrictions holding back the development of the country. Meanwhile opposition ranging from Hindu nationalists to Maoist insurgents chafe under decades of political domination by the Nehru-Gandhi family. Can the Indian National Congress maintain their hold on power or will India forge a new destiny for the coming century?"
