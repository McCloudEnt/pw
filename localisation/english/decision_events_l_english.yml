 decision_event.1.d:0 "Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts was assassinated on Wednesday, March 16, 1955 at 11:42am in Albany, New York just minutes after meeting Governor William Harriman. Kennedy was in secret talks with the Governor of New York concerning possible cabinet membership in the event of the former's victory in an upcoming presidential election. Walking out of the State Capitol in the arms of wife Jacqueline, young Senator Kennedy was fatally shot by lone gunman David Ferrie. The presidential hopeful was pronounced dead at Albany Medical Center approximately twenty-five minutes after the terrifying shooting. While conspiracies have circulated wildly since that day, the generally accepted consensus is that Kennedy's numerous calls for peace in Cuba no matter the cost agitated Ferrie's strong anti-Communist sentiments. It is also believed that the pilot assumed Kennedy was preparing for a Presidential bid in 1956, and assassinating him early was the only way to stop a 'Marxist sympathizer' from occupying the White House. His death is seen by some as a turning point in American political history, unbeknownst to those at the time, as Kennedy's immense popularity indicated that in a presidential race he would win a landslide. Hence the political troubles plaguing upcoming elections could have been avoided."

Eisenhower won a landslide victory over Democrat Adlai Stevenson, ending a string of Democratic Party wins that stretched back to 1932. Incumbent Democratic President Harry S. Truman had initially sought a second full term, but the unpopular incumbent withdrew from the race following North Korea's devastating victory in the Korean War. After Truman's withdrawal, the president and other party leaders rallied around Stevenson, the moderate Governor of Illinois. Stevenson emerged victorious on the third presidential ballot of the 1952 Democratic National Convention, defeating Kefauver, Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia, and other candidates. The Republican nomination was primarily contested by conservative Governor Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Eisenhower, a general who was widely popular for his leadership in World War II. With the support of Thomas E. Dewey and other party leaders, Eisenhower narrowly prevailed over Taft at the 1952 Republican National Convention. The Republicans chose Richard Nixon, a young anti-Communist Senator from California, as Eisenhower's running mate. Eisenhower retained his enormous popularity from the war, as seen in his campaign slogan, "I Like Ike." Eisenhower's popularity and Truman's unpopularity led to a Republican victory, and Eisenhower won 55% of the popular vote. He carried every state outside of the South and won several Southern states that had almost always voted for Democrats since the end of Reconstruction. Republicans also won control of both houses of Congress."

 decision_event.3.d:0 "The Korean Peace Agreement, known commonly around the world as the 'surrender at Okpo-dong' was the unconditional surrender of American forces on the Korean peninsula on July 5, 1952. In the weeks preceding, a small remaining number of troops was isolated within the South-Eastern tip of Korea, notably after the fall of Busan to Communist forces. On Geoje Island, General Mark Clark desperately awaited evacuation, but as time passed realised that the government had abandoned all hope of bringing them back safely. On the fourth of July Clark's troops surrendered to encircling KPA units, and the following day signed an agreement that formally terminated all American military presence in Korea, although it was already technically illegal internationally. The surrender at Okpo-dong was not just a victory in conflict for North Korea, but also a major propaganda success, with the image of shattered US soldiers being spread far and wide across the world. For the first time in recent memory, America had lost."

Mossadegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a British corporation nd to limit the company's control over Iranian petroleum reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to cooperate with the Iranian government, the parliament voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government. Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that CIA involvement would set. Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, to rule more firmly as monarch."

 decision_event.5.d:0 "The 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat was a covert operation carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency that deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. Code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, it installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala. Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Arbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station that broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Arbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador. Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, and contributed to long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America."

The divisive incumbent President, Republican Dwight Eisenhower successfully ran for re-election. Eisenhower, who had first become famous for his military leadership in World War II, had become far more divisive than expected due to his tough stance on Communism appearing to fail. Nevertheless, he was unopposed at the Republican National Convention and faced a broad national following similar to but not quite to the extent of his first election campaign. Governor William Harriman defeated 1952 nominee Adlai Stevenson and other candidates to seize the Democratic Party's nomination, calling for a 'New Wave' against well-established social policies. In the end, Harriman's attempt at creating a populist movement while clearly being a member of the elite establishment doomed the Democratic Party in 1956, handing a second term to President Eisenhower on election night. The incumbent lost support with Republicans but surprisingly made significant gains among Democrats, especially white urban Southerners and Northern Catholics. This would be the last presidential election where a candidate won outright until 1972."

 decision_event.7.d:0 "The civil rights movement was a decades-long movement with the goal of securing legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already held. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection of all Americans. Moderates in the movement worked with Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation overturning discriminatory practices. President Rhodes' Civil Rights Act of 1966 expressly banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices; ended unequal application of voter registration requirements; and prohibited racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in public accommodations. Successive legislation rapidly ended legal inequality in the United States, most notably during the Rhodes Presidency and his successor Lyndon Johnson's first year. From 1962 through 1971, a wave of inner-city riots in black communities undercut support from the white middle class but increased support from private foundations. The emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted from about 1963 to 1982, challenged the established black leadership for its cooperative attitude and its practice of nonviolence, and instead demanding that, in addition to the new laws gained through the nonviolent movement, political and economic self-sufficiency be built in the black community. The charismatic universally recognised leader of the civil rights movement Martin Luther King played a significant role in inspiring millions around the nation, and his assassination attempt is seen as the final blow against pro-segregation movements."

In a closely contested election, Republican Vice President Richard Nixon defeated Democrat George Smathers. This was the first election in which all fifty states participated, the first in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for another term, and the first since 1876 where the winner was decided by the House. Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Smathers, a Florida senator on the other hand battled against a range of adversaries. Most notably Lyndon B. Johnson, who after losing the nomination to Smathers, formed his own 'Independent Democrat' party to contest the November election. The issue of the Cold War dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the Soviet Union. Nixon only just seized the highest number of electoral college votes, six higher than Democratic nominee Smathers and far above Johnson's forty-nine. Due to no candidate reaching the 269 threshold, the House of Representatives was called upon to elect the 35th President of the United States. Having won in both houses since the early 1950s, the Republican Party controversially approved Vice President Nixon's rise to the highest office in the land. For a brief period of extremely unusual political intricacies, Nixon's running mate Jim Rhodes became President as a caretaker head of state, later rising to the call again after the President's assassination on election night 1964."

In response to a failed counterrevolutionary coup in Havana, sponsored by the United States and Haiti, Soviet leader Malenkov decided to agree to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during telephone calls between Malenkov and Fidel Castro in March 1961 and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that Summer. Secretary of State William Rogers managed to convince the initially cautious Richard Nixon to establish a military blockade in order to prevent missiles from reaching Cuba. Under Secretary of State and alleged mastermind behind the blockade Henry Kissinger announced to a White House press conference that the United States would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba. Demands were subsequently made that the remaining missiles be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union. After a long period of tense negotiations, Nixon fired Secretary Rogers for attempting to subvert the President's authority and organize another Haitian-backed coup in Cuba. Following the shocking expulsion, Nixon came to be seen as a communist sympathizer in the last days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, finally conceding to Malenkov in a spectacular capitulation. On August 15, 1961, the United States agreed to withdraw all nuclear missiles from Turkey and Italy, and the Soviet Union was permitted to maintain half of its arsenal on the island of Cuba. The crisis remains a low point for US supremacy in the Cold War, giving Moscow an edge that would last for at least another decade."

The President, set on a political collision course with Democrat Lyndon Johnson and Independent Nelson Rockefeller that very night, was being heckled by another guest of the hotel when multiple shots were fired at the commander-in-chief from behind. Lee Harvey Oswald was the gunman who murdered Nixon on 1964's election night, supposedly for the sole purpose of destabilising his home nation in the short term. After Oswald was tackled to the ground by secret service agents, the President was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, but despite the work of Los Angeles' finest doctors died approximately fifty minutes later. Votes cast in Nixon's name at the ballot box were subsequently transferred to Vice President Jim Rhodes, who would go on to be elected President by the House of Representatives with the support of a battered Nelson Rockefeller. Alongside other dates in American history, the assassination of President Nixon is considered one of the most impactful and destabilising, as the widely accepted view is that after his presidency the state of national politics was forever in turmoil seemingly without opportunity to repair."

In one of the most chaotic and hotly contested elections in American history, Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson defeated the incumbent Republican President Jim Rhodes, American Independent Party nominee George Wallace and the Republican rebel Ronald Reagan. It was the first election since 1860 where four different candidates won electoral votes and the third election in a row where the winner was decided by the House. Johnson contested the Democratic primaries for the third time in a row but was challenged by anti-war Democrat Eugene McCarthy. Despite an initial strong showing from McCarthy, Johnson secured the Democratic nomination for a second time, running a campaign in favor of the war. President Rhodes likewise faced a challenge from the conservative governor of California, Ronald Reagan, who refused to concede defeat in the primaries and ran his own independent campaign. Alabama Governor George Wallace ran on the American Independent Party ticket, campaigning in favor of racial segregation and an end to the Vietnam War. The election year was tumultuous; it was marked by widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses, the assassination attempt on Martin Luther King Jr. and the subsequent riots across the nation. No candidate won enough electoral votes to declare outright victory on election night. The House of Representatives were forced to elect Johnson in a very contentious decision, as North Carolina had declared a state of emergency and were unable to carry out a recount of the vote."

The aim of the invasion was to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalized the canal. Israel began the invasion on October 29th, to which Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. In response the two western powers landed troops along the Suez Canal on November 5th. The Egyptian forces were defeated, but they succeeded in blocking the canal to all shipping, making it strategically useless. It later became clear that the three powers had conspired and planned out the invasion beforehand. Heavy political pressure from the United States and the Soviet Union eventually led to a withdrawal, as President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened serious damage to the British financial system by selling the US government's pound sterling bonds. Israel did secure freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran, which Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Despite this military success the invasion was a decisive diplomatic victory for Nasser, who secured support from the Soviet Union and strengthened his position as President of Egypt while the Western powers were humiliated. The crisis led to the resignation of British prime minister Anthony Eden and is seen as the end of Britain's role as a major world power."

Ashbrook defeated Democratic nominee George Wallace. Incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson chose not to seek a second term in office, even though he was constitutionally allowed to, due to his compromise with the Southern wing of the Democratic Party. Instead George Wallace, the arbiter of that compromise, quickly surpassed Vice President Edmund Muskie to become the leading Democratic candidate. To the surprise of many Wallace made a sharp turn to the left, dropping his segregationist stance and announcing that he had always been a ‘moderate’ on racial matters. He did well in the South and among alienated and dissatisfied voters with his populist ‘outsider’ image, easily winning the Democratic nomination. The Republican primary was primarily fought between the conservative John M. Ashbrook and the liberal Pete McCloskey. Ashbrook’s nomination was assured when he won an upset victory in California, McCloskey’s home state. The state of the economy was the most important issue of the election. While Wallace championed many of Johnson’s anti-poverty programs, Ashbrook saw them as a massive hole in the federal budget. The economic crises of the previous administrations did little to endear these programs to the American public, who instead turned to Ashbrook’s supply-side economic policies. Ashbrook won the election in a landslide, becoming the first candidate to win an outright majority since 1956 by carrying nearly every northern state and even challenging Wallace’s hold over the ‘Solid South’."

Rogers revealed highly classified documents to the United Nations General Assembly, detailing the Ashbrook administration’s plans to invade Spain and restore the Francoist dictatorship in collusion with hardliners in the Spanish Armed Forces. The plan was for US forces stationed in Spain to link up with troops under Major General Jaime Milans del Bosch and march on Madrid to depose King Juan Carlos I, who had initiated political reforms after the death of Caudillo Francisco Franco the previous year. This was justified in the name of preventing a socialist takeover, as had happened two years earlier in Portugal. These revelations were met by immediate condemnation from the international community, even from American allies. President Ashbrook responded by denying the allegations and firing General Rogers, who claimed to have acted in America’s interest, fearing that the invasion would irreparably damage America’s international standing. He would defend his actions even as he was charged for treason in 1978. Following the revelations President Ashbrook popularity saw the greatest dive in American history, just ahead of the 1976 election. But the country most impacted was Spain itself. Fearing disloyalty in the army, King Juan Carlos I halted the country’s democratic transition, declaring martial law and beginning the Spanish Years of Lead."

This humiliating comment quickly spread from coast to coast, attention divided evenly between Johnson’s alleged comments and Malenkov’s response. The White House denied all allegations and even tried to push back against Moscow for their supposed slander, heightening tensions between the two powers during a particularly volatile period in America.

The speech is considered to be a major step in Georgy Malenkov’s ‘Positive Foreign Policy’, and was well received by the American delegation. President John M. Ashbrook had long been a supporter of a more active anti-communist foreign policy, but soon came to approve Malenkov’s calls for deescalation. The two would meet several times between 1974 and 1975 in the so-called Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, which resulted in the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, signed in Moscow on May 26, 1975. The treaty would limit the development of anti-ballistic missile systems in order to reduce the pressure to build more nuclear weapons in order to maintain deterrence. The SALT discussions were concurrent with the ongoing Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, a series of meetings in Helsinki and Geneva between all European nations, including Canada and the United States, from 1973 to 1975. The meetings resulted in the Helsinki Accords, a document which sought to improve the détante between East and West, ensure the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all European nations, and respect for human rights, especially in the Eastern bloc. Though the accords would become a hallmark of European politics for decades, the détente would be short-lived. The death of Spanish Caudillo Francisco Franco and the subsequent Spanish-American Crisis in 1976 would mark the end of the détente, as tensions exacerbated to an even higher level than before 1974."

In the years prior, much of the Soviet economy was still dedicated to military production, and scientists were directed to essentially find new ways to defend the USSR from a foreign invasion. Malenkov’s NSP drastically reduced the defence budget and instead allocated those funds towards almost every other sector, in particular infrastructure and developments in both urban and rural areas. While extremely controversial at the time, the initiative was seen as one of the greatest moments of Malenkov’s career in the top job, as it ensured that the Soviets wouldn’t waste their revenue on gargantuan military spending, as the United States did for much of the Cold War to combat falsified Soviet military figures."

American politicians had already expressed some support for an expedition to the Moon, and of course other planets in the Solar System. Their Soviet counterparts also expressed the same desire to their General Secretary, but Malenkov’s response came in the form of a speech to the 1958 Congress that would go down in history as one of the most defining moments of the space race. The General Secretary declared that while the USSR would invest into space developments, it would not be utilising limited funds to simply explore space and outspend the United States. Intead, satellites would be the main focus of the Soviet space program, as they could genuinely help with the economic development of the Union, as well as ensuring the military security and safety of our borders. The speech was a disappointment for many who saw the 1960s as a decade for unprecedented space exploration, in which humanity would reach the Moon and beyond, colonising every rock we could land on. However, historians believe the speech defined how Soviet policy at the time was intelligently dedicated to economic advancement and proving socialism could function and serve its citizens on the ground better than capitalism. Because in contrast, the United States and its allies in Europe spent ridiculous sums on endeavours in space, such as the famous Moon landing of 1971, and yet the propaganda of these missions was minimal once the celebrations had passed weeks later."

Removed from the confines of his allegiance to Lavrentiy Beria, Malenkov’s initial vision for Soviet domestic and foreign policy could be implemented with absolutely no opposition from any organ within the ruling party. Although the late 1960s are seen as the beginning and first brutal years of the Great Freeze, the assassination of Andrei Gromyko in 1971 by an agent of the KGB highlighted the peak of those harsh years, with the General Secretary finally removing the last obstacle to his concept of ‘Positive Foreign Policy’, and triggering the gradual ‘1970s Thaw’, a carefully manipulated plan to encroach upon Europe, after having spread revolution upon revolution in the third world. The Freeze unofficially ended with the expulsion of Leonid Brezhnev’s increasingly large faction of the Communist Party, a clique committed to hardline policy on all fronts, that had grown more and more powerful through Malenkov’s de-liberalisation."

Ashbrook started off the campaign as one of the most popular presidents in recent history and he went unchallenged in the Republican primaries. But the Spanish-American Crisis and its political fallout led the Republican Party leadership to unsuccessfully try to block his nomination, leading to a chaotic convention with protests not seen since 1968. Carter was little-known at the start of the Democratic primaries, but the former governor of Georgia emerged as the front-runner after his victories in the first set of primaries. Campaigning as a political moderate, reformer and Washington outsider, Carter defeated opponents such as Jerry Brown and Mo Udall to clinch the Democratic nomination. Ashbrook was hampered by the ongoing impeachment trials and trailed Carter by wide margins for most of the campaign. But his popularity rebounded after a strong performance in the presidential debates and his acquittal by the Senate, and the race was close on election day. Carter won a majority of the popular and electoral vote. He carried the entire West Coast and nearly every state in the South while Ashbrook dominated the Midwest and Northeast.

The specific charges were abuse of power and obstruction of justice, stemming from Ashbrook’s plans to illegally invade the Kingdom of Spain and his attempts to mislead the investigation into the plans once they were revealed to the United Nations. Many of the presidents’ allies in Congress abandoned him during the crisis while his popularity sunk to its lowest point ever. On September 3, 1976 Ashbrook became the second president in American history to be impeached when the Republican-dominated House formally adopted the articles of impeachment and forwarded them to the Senate. The trial began the same month, presided over by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. The case was seen as unwinnable and many of the president’s allies, including Vice President Pete McCloskey and Senator Barry Goldwater, advised him to resign rather than face conviction, but Ashbrook chose to fight it anyway. The two month-long trial became one of the most publicized events in American history, coinciding with Ashbrook’s campaign for the 1976 election. It came down to only two votes, as on October 23 the Senate voted 65-35 to convict the president. Lacking the necessary two-thirds majority of senators present for conviction and removal from office, Ashbrook was narrowly acquitted on both counts only 10 days before the election."

On the 1st of March 1953, Stalin suffered a cerebral hemorrhage during a stay at his Kuntsevo Dacha. Despite the best efforts of the medical crew on hand, Joseph Stalin passed away on the 5th. By the time of his death, Stalin had led the Soviet Union for 29 years and 43 days, having taken over in the aftermath of Lenin’s death in 1924. His rule was marked by the advent of totalitarianism, with multiple purges of Soviet society taking place on his command and the establishment of an all-pervasive secret police, but also the hard-fought victory in the Great Patriotic War. As the Soviet state geared up for perhaps the most grandiose funeral in its history yet, the Politburo convened to appoint a successor for the departed General Secretary. As Stalin’s appointed heir, Andrei Zhdanov, had passed away five years prior, leadership instead passed to Georgy Malenkov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers who had succeeded Zhdanov. Facing a power struggle with Second Secretary Nikita Khrushchev over the succession, Malenkov allied with the Minister of Internal Affairs Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Soviet Secret Police.

At the same time, it was feared that a single figure would much like Stalin become too powerful. As such, to fill this power vacuum, Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria ended up forming a troika with Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov in an attempt to stave off the reformists in the Politburo, led by Nikita Khrushchev. This alliance was fraught with conflict, as Beria was perhaps the most reviled figure within the Soviet Union, despised for his frequent sexual predation upon the people of Moscow. The alliance held, however, as their combined hold upon the state apparatus was required to resist Khrushchev’s support within the Communist Party itself. The dissolution of the General Secretariat in 1952 meant the title of leadership was now First Secretary, a title Malenkov was barely able to attain, with Nikita Khrushchev holding onto his role as Second Secretary, while also being made First Secretary of the Moscow Party Committee as consolation. With that, a new equilibrium was reached. Malenkov and Beria earned the loyalty of the people with tacit liberalisation, like mass prisoner releases and a slight loosening of censorship in the media, while Molotov secured the support of the Soviet allies in the recently founded Warsaw Pact. Khrushchev’s reformist opposition remained, however, challenging the agenda of the governing troika at multiple avenues in the coming years."

 decision_event.24.d:0 "The 1959 Soviet Coup Attempt was an unsuccessful attempt at removing Premier Georgy Malenkov from office. The coup was led by Nikita Krushchev and his allies in the Communist Party, who became branded as the ‘Anti-Party Group’. This group believed that liberalization was proceeding too slowly and that Malenkov’s reorientation of the economy away from the military was a threat to the Soviet Union. But most of all they opposed the influence of KGB Chairman Lavrentiy Beria, who was seen as the puppetmaster behind Malenkov. These reformers had clashed with the Soviet leadership ever since the death of Joseph Stalin. Khrushchev held a powerful position in the secretariat and his words carried a lot of power in the party. For Beria it became clear that something had to be done to stave him off, therefore the KGB began a campaign of scrutinization against both Khrushchev and his allies, aiming to ruin their reputations so they could be expelled from the party. Despite the paramount secrecy of the operation, word did eventually reach Khrushchev of the plot. In response he called up all his supporters in the Presidium; reformers like Anastas Mikoyan as well as disconcerted members like Nikolai Bulganin. The group urged Malenkov to resign during a meeting in the Presidium, and moved to position Khrushchev as the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers. It was quickly put to a vote, and one that came down to a narrow result: The proposal was voted down 6 to 5, with Minister of Defense Kliment Voroshilov delivering the final vote in Malenkov’s favour. In the aftermath, the ‘Anti-Party Group’ were expelled from the Presidium to a variety of positions on the fringes of the Soviet Union while Khrushchev was tried and executed for treason. In the end Malenkov and Beria had strengthened their positions as leaders and could now look to governing without any opposition."

The purpose of the summit was to strengthen the cause of Socialism in East Asia, and discuss means for which these socialist states could collaborate for this purpose. A grand show was put on by the Chinese hosts, with a grand military parade and a boisterous propaganda campaign to signify to their socialist partners that China was no more a nation of anarchy and warlords, but rather a strong and powerful partner of the Socialist bloc, with Chairman Mao Zedong inaugurating the summit. Talks between the representatives proceeded smoothly, although Mao proved quite tenacious in wanting to make this a project in which China had equal standing with the Soviet Union, despite the leading role typically undertaken by the Soviets. In the end, a series of trade deals were struck, with the Soviets providing their Asian allies with modern industrial machinery and technical experience in exchange for preferential prices on food imports, as well as promises of mutual military assistance programs in case of conflicts with the West. Of note for Western Kremlinologists was the secondary role held by foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov during the Summit, with Georgy Malenkov leading the Soviet delegation and personally being responsible for most of the negotiations. As the Summit drew to a close, the Socialist powers of Asia stood stronger but more importantly, stood together."

The revolution was supported by various Islamist and leftist organizations and student movements. Demonstrations against the Shah began in October 1977, developing into a campaign of civil resistance that included both secular and religious elements. The protests rapidly intensified in 1978 as a result of the burning of Rex Cinema which was seen as the main cause of the revolution, and between August and December that year, strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country. The Shah left Iran in exile on 16 January 1979, as the last Persian monarch, leaving his duties to a regency council and Shapour Bakhtiar, who was an opposition-based prime minister. Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was invited back to Iran by the government, and returned to Tehran to a greeting by several million Iranians. The royal reign collapsed shortly after, on 11 February, when guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting, bringing Khomeini to official power. Bakhtiar’s government collapsed and he was replaced by Mehdi Bazargan on the orders of Ayatollah Khomeini. Soon after, liberals and leftists began organizing a massive campaign of resistance against Islamic rule and on 1 April, 1979 Iran voted by national referendum to reject Ayatollah Khomeini’s proposed theocratic-republican constitution. In the aftermath of the vote, supporters of the more liberal Bazargan carried out a coup, taking control of the government and forcing the Ayatollah to relinquish power. With the prime minister now as the undisputed leader of the government and the revolution, Iran had successfully transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a liberal democracy."

Republican nominee Ronald Reagan defeated incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter, Libertarian nominee Ed Clark and Communist Party USA General Secretary Gus Hall in a landslide victory. Carter's unpopularity and poor relations with Democratic leaders encouraged an intra-party challenge by Senator Ted Kennedy, who was eventually defeated at the national convention. The Republican primaries were contested between Reagan, who had previously served as the Governor of California, former Congressman George H. W. Bush of Texas, and several other candidates. All of Reagan's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries, and the national convention nominated a ticket consisting of Reagan and Bush. Reagan campaigned for increased defense spending, implementation of supply-side economic policies, and a balanced budget. His campaign was aided by Democratic dissatisfaction with Carter and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation. Both Carter and Hall attacked Reagan as a dangerous right-wing extremist who would cut Medicare and Social Security. Hall went further, arguing that only a transition to socialism would end the country’s economic malaise. Clark on the other hand supported many of Reagan’s economic policies, but strongly opposed his proposals for a military buildup, positioning himself as the ‘peace candidate’. Reagan won the election by a landslide, taking a large majority of the electoral vote and nearly half of the popular vote. Carter came second but carried just eight states. The Libertarians won three states in the south as well as Maine, while the Communists won Hawaii, Oregon and several faithless electors from California. Reagan received the highest number of electoral votes ever won by a non-incumbent presidential candidate. Reagan’s victory is often seen as the beginning of the end for the United States, as he would be the last president before the Great Collapse seven years later."

In the United States the crisis began in 1980 and lasted until the collapse of the country in 1987, with many of its effects being felt throughout the next decade. A key event leading to the recession was the 1979 Oil Crisis, mostly caused by the Iranian Revolution. What followed was a disruption of the global oil supply and the sharp rise of oil prices worldwide. This caused the already high American inflation to rise to new double-digit highs. The monetary policy undertaken by the Federal Reserve did little to combat the rising inflation and is in fact seen as a contributing factor to the crisis in America. After President Ronald Reagan assumed office in 1981 he began to tackle the crisis by implementing sweeping tax cuts. But as the crisis deepened in 1982, Reagan’s approval rating also dropped. As a result the Republicans lost their majority in Congress during the 1982 Midterm Elections. Faced with an increasingly uncooperative legislature, where socialist and communist parties had made large gains, Reagan was unable to push through any meaningful legislation to combat the crisis. As a result the economy continued to spiral downward until the United States dissolved in 1987, leaving the crisis to be handled by the newly independent states of America."

The report came at a pivotal moment in Soviet history, with Malenkov riding the coattails of his successful diffusion of the Cuban Missile Crisis two years prior, making him able to leverage greater influence in domestic politics. As such, the report would be held up as a significant indicator for Malenkov’s domestic policies, causing great excitement in the Soviet government. The report ended up validating Malenkov’s supporters greatly, indicating that the Soviet economy had responded well to the change of attention in favour of civilian industries, as well as the cuts to the bloated Military-Industrial Complex. Of note was the RSFSR, where republic leader Alexei Kosygin had achieved particularly great results under the New Socialist Platform. As such, the 1963 Economic Report proved not just a victory for Georgy Malenkov, but also for the technocratic faction within the State Planning Committee, who would see further successes down the line. In the aftermath of the report, further economic reforms would be undertaken, as Malenkov increasingly promoted the technocratic wing, pushing the more orthodox Marxist-Leninist planners further and further out of influence."

Emboldened by the success of the New Socialist Platform, Malenkov felt that he could now act independently of Lavrentiy Beria, and moved to reshuffle the recently rechristened Politburo. The Politburo was still largely consisting of aging politicians from the Stalin Era, as well as a few new ones added in the aftermath of the aborted 1959 coup, and as such Beria still had allies within the organ. Many older politicians, save the inner circle of Malenkov, Beria and Vyacheslav Molotov, were ‘encouraged’ to retire and replaced with younger faces, including the shining star of the 1963 Economic Report, Alexei Kosygin, who took up charge as the Minister of Finance and was entrusted with a wide berth to carry out his reforms. This heavily strengthened the position of Malenkov in the Politburo, as many of the younger additions had few ties to the old government of Joseph Stalin. As such, Lavrentiy Beria was increasingly marginalized within the Politburo, and although Malenkov made no direct moves against the Chairman of the KGB himself, his position now appeared much more precarious with the removal of multiple supporters from the Politburo. Much like with Nikita Khrushchev five years prior, Beria feared that if he did not act soon, he would lose any chance of power. A new power struggle was brewing in the Communist Party, as relations between Malenkov and Beria cooled drastically in the months following the reshuffle."

Repression throughout the Union had silently risen over the last few years, as the liberalisation enacted during the first few years of Malenkov’s rule had silently receded, all on Beria’s encouragement. Resentment towards the Soviet state apparatus simmered, and eventually, something was going to give. On the 14th of September, unusual movements by the KGB were noticed, and the day later, Beria struck, occupying key infrastructure across Moscow, including the recently completed Ostankino Television Tower, as well as the Kremlin complex. In a speech to the people of Moscow, Beria claimed to have acted to stop ‘the return of the Great Terror’ by a ‘tyrant in the waiting’, calling upon the people of the city to support the KGB forces. They did not succeed in detaining Malenkov, however, who had been tipped off just minutes before Beria’s coup by a KGB whistleblower. Malenkov was hurried off to suburban Moscow, from where he seized control of a local radio station, and shortly after Beria’s speech gave his response. Malenkov squarely put the blame on Beria for every act of repression, every act of cruelty from the Soviet government, in a surprisingly emotional speech from the First Secretary, as calling for the people to rise up against this ‘Red Napoleon’. The people of Moscow quickly picked their side, forming up alongside loyalist elements and drove the unmotivated KGB forces from the city. Beria was captured trying to flee the city, and was sentenced to death for high treason shortly after. In the aftermath, tight controls were put upon the KGB by the Soviet government, to ensure that no such coups may happen again. With that, Malenkov now ruled the Soviet Union alone, as paramount leader, with nobody able to challenge his power. "

At 05:23 in the morning, the city centre was struck by the earthquake, which killed somewhere between 15 and 5500 people. As Tashkent still consisted mostly of densely built, traditional adobe residences, 80% of the city, including more than half of the old city, was demolished by the quake, rendering hundreds of thousands of citizens homeless. The Soviet government knew it had to act quickly, but also saw an opportunity to rebuild the city as a model of Soviet modernity. Construction workers from all across the Soviet Union arrived in the city, to clear the rubble and rehouse the hundreds of thousands in temporary lodgings, while planners in Moscow began to draw up their plans for the new Tashkent. The new city would be defined by wide boulevards and large-scale, earthquake-resistant high rises, as a showcase to the people of what the Soviet Union would bring. However, reconstruction also saw many old landmarks such as the 600-year old mosques of the city swept aside in favour of modern parks and facilities, causing some to opine that the city has lost most of its history. Nevertheless, Tashkent became the model for a new period in Soviet urban planning, emphasizing modernist architecture and for the first time in Soviet history, a greater emphasis on individual rather than collective apartments, on the request of the growing Brezhnevite faction within the Communist Party, a period that would last until the death of Georgy Malenkov in 1988."

It was the first election to be held after the Great American Collapse. Prime Minister Mulroney, first elected by a landslide in 1984, had become extremely unpopular due to the fallout of the collapse. The economic crisis that swept through Canada had devastated much of the country’s industry, and Mulroney’s insistence on maintaining close ties to the former U.S. led him to accept millions of American refugees into the country. This policy ultimately failed to prevent the rise of hostile regimes on the Canadian border everywhere except Alaska, and caused further pressure on the already suffering Canadian people. The New Democratic Party, led by Ed Broadbent, soon overshadowed John Turner's unpopular Liberal Party to become the main opposition to Mulroney, cementing themselves as a pacifist party dedicated to building a self-sufficient Canada, free from dependence on NATO or global capitalism. Broadbent's message resonated with Western and Eastern voters both, and his New Democratic Party was able to break Progressive Conservative strangleholds in Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and even Ontario and Quebec, achieving a majority of seats in Canada's House of Commons. Mulroney’s PCs suffered the greatest loss for a ruling party in Canadian history, while the Liberals had their worst electoral result ever, being relegated to third-party status.

The aging CPUSA General Secretary Gus Hall chose to not stand in the election, instead endorsing Angela Davis for the presidency. The campaign was tense, Reagan was widely criticized for his failure to tackle the economic crisis, which had been exacerbated by the supply-side economics implemented by his administration.

The conflict began in June 1948, when the colonial government in Malaya declared a state of emergency following the murder of three Europeans during an attack on a plantation. Those responsible for the murders retreated into the Malayan jungles where, under the leadership of Chin Peng, they formed the MNLA as the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party, intending to overthrow the colonial government. The rebels established a series of jungle bases and began conducting raids on British colonial police and military installations. Tin mines and rubber plantations became frequent targets of communist sabotage in attempts to make the colonial occupation of Malaya too expensive to maintain. Though early on the Malayan government was unable to effectively fight back against the rebels, by 1950 the British army instigated the use of the Briggs’ Plan which involved the forced relocation of an estimated 500,000 rural Malayans to guarded camps known as ‘new villages’. These villages were recently constructed and, in most cases, were surrounded by barbed wires, police posts and floodlit areas to keep the inhabitants in and the guerillas out. By 1957, the Federation of Malaya was granted independence from the British Empire and the war of national liberation became untenable for the communists. Three years later the Emergency was declared over, as amnesty had been declared and most communists had left the country.

The SDP was the main beneficiary of these defections, as well as those of former Liberal Democrats. It allowed the party to present themselves as the heirs of the Keynesian legacy of both the Liberals and Labour, advocating increased social spending and lower taxes to recover from the crisis. Despite fierce campaigning from all three major parties, none were able to achieve a majority in Parliament. But the SDP achieved a clear plurality, leading Owen to enter an alliance with the Conservatives and become prime minister in the first coalition government since the Second World War."

 decision_event.45.d:0 "The Treaty of Strasbourg, officially known as the Treaty Establishing the European Union of Socialist Republics, was a treaty signed by all core members of the European Communities. The treaty had its origins in the Crocodile Club established by Italian MEP Altiero Spinelli in 1980 to promote European integration and federalism. The group established the Committee on Institutional Affairs in 1982, tasked with drafting a constitution for the European Communities. Though the club started out as an informal cross-party group, Spinelli was a former member of the Italian Communist Party and the committee increasingly fell under the influence of its communist members, especially after the European elections in 1984. The committee presented the initial Draft Treaty to the European Parliament before the elections, and it was approved, but then rewritten after the Communist and Allies Group won a plurality of the seats in the parliament. The following months saw Communist-led governments come to power in nearly all EC members, as well as the reunification of Germany in 1984. This renewed interest for reform in Europe, leading to an alliance in the European Parliament between the Communist and Allies Group and the Socialist Group, which led negotiations alongside the European Commission and the national governments to draft the new treaty. On 27 October 1985, the Treaty of Strasbourg was signed by all members of the European Communities, except the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, who were subsequently expelled from the newly-established European Union of Socialist Republics as per its founding treaty."

On 6 December 1990, the British press uncovered photographs of leading figures within the Liberal Democrats, most prominently former Liberal leader and foreign affairs spokesman David Steel meeting with Manfred Gerlach, leader of the European Liberals and Democrats, in Luxembourg. Though the Liberal Democrats still maintained ties to the ELD, it was widely considered to have become a communist front organization in the European Parliament. The meeting allegedly involved the discussion of favorable trade deals and closer ties to the EUSR should the Liberal Democrats come to power, which at the time seemed increasingly likely. The party initially denied all allegations, but as time went by more and more evidence was released to the public. Despite this, party leader Paddy Ashdown continued to deny any knowledge of the meeting. By late December, Steel and his entourage were expelled from the party and the Liberal Democrats withdrew from the ELD. Despite this, the party’s popularity continued to decline, eventually leading Ashdown to push for a purge of any ‘communist sympathizers’ in the party. This was the final straw for many party members, thousands of which defected to join the Social Democratic Party. Ashdown resigned shortly afterwards, but it was not enough for the party to recover, as the following year the party received its worst share of the vote in history, winning only three seats."

On 20 October 1952, the Kenyan colonial government declared a state of emergency following the assassination of Senior Chief Waruhiu, a native British loyalist, by Mau Mau fighters. The Kenyan government reacted by imprisoning hundreds of alleged Mau Mau leaders within Nairobi. Among those arrested was Jomo Kenyatta, a key anti-colonialist activist and future president of Kenya. The operation failed to provide the government with a quick end to the rebellion, as the news of the plan was leaked, allowing for the escape of high ranking officials within the KLFA. The declaration of the emergency caused thousands of Mau Mau loyalists to flee to the forests where they fought a guerilla war against the colonial government. Across the world, the British were fighting similar opponents in Malaya, and the British army successfully copied tactics from the rebellion there to counter the Mau Mau coalition. By the end of 1955 the head of the Kenyan colonial administration, Governor Evelyn Baring, offered concessions to the natives including land reform, the right to vote, increased wages and the relaxation of the ban on their right to grow cash crops. A year later the Mau Mau were virtually defeated with the capture of rebel leader Dedan Kimathi. But the state of emergency continued until 1960, and some Mau Mau fighters would continue the resistance against the Kenyan government even after independence in 1963."

The dispute concerned the role of the United Kingdom in what remained of NATO, now functionally reduced to just Canada and the American ‘remnant’ government in Atlanta. Prime Minister David Owen had previously called for Britain to ‘forget about the alliance’, but the coalition agreement signed with the Conservatives stipulated that Britain would remain committed to NATO for the foreseeable future. But this commitment was not reciprocated. The Canadian government under Ed Broadbent showed little interest in continuing the alliance, and the unrecognized government of George Bush held no influence outside its borders. With the reality of the situation in mind, Owen began negotiating the draft of a security treaty with the Irish government in 1992, in order to ensure the protection of the British Isles. But as negotiations continued, it became increasingly clear that this new treaty would supersede Britain’s commitment to NATO, which was unacceptable to Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine. The revelations led to infighting within the coalition government, which ground the political process to a halt and slowed the implementation of Owen’s recovery plan. When the details of the treaty became public, they were repudiated by the Conservative Party, who subsequently announced their withdrawal from the coalition government. Owen’s attempts to gain support from the Labour Party were also unsuccessful, leading to a vote of no confidence and the eventual dissolution of parliament on 21 February 1993."

An ambitious program intended to rectify what Malenkov saw as a major flaw in the old Stalinist foreign policy doctrine, which had neglected relations with the African continent. With this, he hoped to show the benefits of socialism to the third world, increase the prestige of the Soviet Union and improve relations with anti-imperialist governments across the continent. The initiative opened the doors of Soviet universities to students from Africa, prioritising their admission over that of other foreign students. At the same time, Malenkov also committed to sending Soviet medical personnel to allied countries in order to satisfy their healthcare needs until a sufficient number of native doctors had been trained. The policy met opposition from more traditionally inclined members of the Soviet government, like the newly minted foreign minister Andrei Gromyko, who derided the policy as 'collaboration with the anti-imperialist bourgeoisie'. Nevertheless, the initiative was a success, winning the Soviet Union large amounts of goodwill on the continent, and setting the stage for further foreign policy success."

However, the Cominform had been rendered increasingly irrelevant first by the expulsion of Yugoslavia, and then the victory of the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, and had been a vestigial organisation ever since the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. But as the United States was embroiled in the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union looked increasingly respectable on the international stage. Georgy Malenkov wanted to utilise this opportunity and saw his way of doing so in the remnants of the Cominform. So in 1969 the Cominform Bureau was officially dissolved, and in its place the International Socialism Committee was formed as an organisation intended to coordinate the activities of the all communist parties in the world. Taking inspiration from the failings of the Comintern and Cominform, the ISC was intended as a more structured organisation, to which communist parties from all across the world could send a permanent representative. Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, was selected as the host city for the ISC in a gesture to the Western communist parties. Former Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov was selected as the first chairman for the Committee, in recognition of the venerable Soviet politician’s long tenure. Unlike the Cominform, the International Socialism Committee proved effective, even managing to reach into the United States of America, where its American member party would in the following decades grow to national prominence."

Eventually, this opposition became too much for Malenkov, and he hitched a plan to secure his complete control over Soviet foreign policy. On 11 August 1971, Andrei Gromyko was gunned down in the early morning hours on his way to work by a supposed lone gunman. However, the Main Intelligence Directory was quick to announce that there had been more afoot. Following the capture of the gunman, they discovered that he was actually acting on behalf of the KGB, trying to exact vengeance for the execution of Lavrentiy Beria seven years prior, and that large parts of the organisation were involved in a plot led by KGB Director Aleksandr Sakharovsky, who were allegedly plotting to eliminate the entire Soviet government. Head of the KGB Vladimir Semichastny was quickly discharged and replaced with Main Intelligence Directory head Pyotr Ivashutin, who took charge of a major purge of the organisation. To replace the deceased Gromyko was trade minister Nikolai Patolichev, who proved to be very supportive of Malenkov’s plans for détente, thus removing the last obstacle for a new Soviet foreign policy doctrine."

EOKA, as it was known in Greek, was a right-wing nationalist guerrilla organization that sought the unification of Cyprus with Greece, a concept known as Enosis. Demand for Enosis increased as Greek Cypriots became increasingly dissatisfied with British rule. The EOKA insurgency began on 1 April 1955 with a series of attacks on British facilities. Subsequent follow-up attacks led Governor John Harding to declare a state of emergency in November of that year. The British forces found it difficult to defeat the insurgents, despite them vastly outnumbered. The EOKA held the support of a majority of Greek Cypriots and British manpower was constantly siphoned to deal with other conflicts across the empire. As casualties mounted on both sides a meeting was called in Lancaster House, London between representatives of the United Kingdom, Turkey, Greece, and the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, Archbishop Makarios III and Dr. Fazıl Küçük respectively.

It was the first general election to be held with Elizabeth II as monarch, with the Queen having succeeded her father George VI a year after the previous election. After Winston Churchill retired in April 1955, Anthony Eden took over and immediately called an election in order to gain a mandate for his government. Eden had long been considered the heir to the Conservative leadership and he hoped to take advantage of the end of food rationing and the positive atmosphere created by the Coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953. The Labour Party on the other hand was led by the now 72-year old Clement Attlee. Many within his party, including the prominent Aneurin Bevan, had hoped he would retire before the election, fearing he was too old to be leader. The party was also divided between the left-wing Bevanites and the right-wing Gaitskellites, and as such their campaign suffered from an unclear election message. As a result the Conservatives won the largest share of the vote for a single party in a post-war general election, winning 345 seats in the House of Commons. This was a small increase since the previous election, and although the Social Democratic Party would win more seats in 1993, no party would ever win as much of the popular vote. Labour was reduced to only 277 seats, and Clement Attlee resigned shortly after the election. With only small changes in the result since 1951, the real highlight of the election night was Northern Ireland, where Sinn Féin won two seats in a general election for the first time since 1918, though their MPs refused to take their seats in Westminster."

Following the collapse of the SDP-Conservative coalition government and the motion of no confidence against Prime Minister David Owen, no other party was able to cobble together enough seats to form a new government. As such Queen Elizabeth II was forced to dissolve parliament and call a new election only seventeen months into its term. The question of NATO dominated the campaign, with the SDP and the Conservative Party on either side of the hotly-contested issue. The Labour Party, like the SDP, supported withdrawing from the organization, but were still hounded by accusations of being Soviet sympathizers. The party also suffered from the emergence of a new challenger to their left, the Communist Party of Great Britain, which had previously only been a minor force in British politics. Some of the most economically devastated areas of the country also saw a rise in support for the fascist British National Party, who competed with the CPGB over working-class votes and whose supporters would often engage in street battles with the police and supporters of other parties. The rise in political violence during the campaign ultimately benefited the SDP, with David Owen taking a hard-line stance on the issue, promising to give further prerogatives to the police to deal with ‘hooligans and street thugs’. The SDP’s gamble paid off, winning a total of 368 seats in the House of Commons. The Conservatives and Labour came a distant second and third respectively.

The two countries’ joint rule over Northern Ireland made security cooperation in the region necessary, and both sides showed an interest in expanding this cooperation to the entirety of the British Isles. But the process was stalled due to the economic and political issues that followed the collapse of the United States in 1987. The negotiations only resumed after David Owen became prime minister in 1991. As none of the remaining NATO countries showed much interest in continuing the alliance, Owen took the initiative to establish a new alliance. The two governments held several conferences in both countries to iron out the details, finally presenting a draft of the treaty in January 1993. The agreement would commit both countries to collective security, establish a joint military command based in Rosyth, Scotland, and expand the United Kingdom’s nuclear umbrella to include Ireland. Disputes within the British government would delay the signing of the treaty, with David Owen returning after another general election. To differentiate themselves from the alliances of the past, the signatories chose the name ‘British Isles Protection Union’ as the name of the organization, signaling their intent to commit themselves to defense only, rather than intervention or expansion."

Sporadic fighting on the undetermined border between the two states occurred throughout the following two years, with the DPRK supporting communist insurgencies in the south. The Korean People’s Army finally crossed the border on 25 June 1950 and quickly captured Seoul before pushing south and surrounding the ROK forces in the city of Pusan. The United Nations attempted to adopt a resolution condemning the invasion, but it was remarkably vetoed by the Soviet Union, who had previously boycotted the organization due to its recognition of the Republic of China as the legitimate government of all China. In response, US President Harry Truman authorized the creation of an intervention force to relieve the embattled ROK forces at Pusan. Together, the American and ROK forces managed to defend the Pusan Perimeter and push back the KPA forces to the city of Andong before the war settled into a gruelling stalemate, as Soviet advisors arrived en-masse to aid the DPRK. By 1951 American forces had gradually withdrawn to the island of Jeju in order to prepare for a renewed naval invasion. The KPA used this opportunity to launch a desperate offensive, successfully breaking the defending lines and collapsing the perimeter. The ROK officially capitulated to the DPRK on 13 January 1952, ending the Korean War. The American forces remained on Jeju until July when they surrendered the surrounding KPA forces."

At first President Nixon’s reelection chances seemed uncertain following the backlash caused by his mishandling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was challenged in the primaries by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller who criticised Nixon’s foreign policy blunders and the slow pace of civil rights legislation. After narrowly losing the nomination to Nixon, Rockefeller formed his own independent ticket with support from the Liberal Party of New York. Johnson easily defeated his primary opponents, most prominently Alabama Governor George Wallace, to secure the Democratic nomination, running on a platform of increased federal anti-poverty programs. Facing two general election challengers with strong liberal credentials Nixon increasingly turned towards the conservative wing of the Republican Party, with future president Ronald Reagan rising to national prominence as one of Nixon’s strongest campaigners. The election result was marred by controversy. Not only did no candidate come close to the 269 electoral votes required for an outright victory, but President Nixon’s assassination on election night cast the whole process into doubt.

As such both Rhodes and Johnson tried to court Rockefeller, who sought increasing concessions from the two contenders. Eventually a compromise was reached between Rockefeller and President Rhodes, who committed himself to support further civil rights legislation and increased national defense spending in exchange for Rockefeller’s support. The compromise was derided as a ‘corrupt bargain’ by Johnson’s supporters, but that didn’t stop Rhodes from being elected president in the contingent election of 1965.

Operated by US Special Forces as part of the Civilian Irregular Defense Group training program, the Australian and American-trained Montagnard garrison had hampered Viet Cong operations for some time, making it difficult to coordinate operations along the Ho Chi Minh trail that crossed the nearby Laotian border. A two-day siege ensued where the defenders, led by Captain Roger Donlon, repelled numerous attempts by Viet Cong sappers to breach the camp, one of which led to his death. Donlon’s death alongside that of several other American and Australian advisors whose respective governments maintained that they acted in ‘non-combatant roles’ engendered calls for further action in support of the government in Saigon. The United States Congress passed a joint resolution the following month known as the ‘Donlon Resolution’, authorizing President Jim Rhodes to conduct American military action in Vietnam without an official declaration of war on the grounds of aiding a fellow SEATO member-state.

Paris was chosen as the site of the negotiations by the North Vietnamese delegation, unofficially led by Lê Đuc Tho, while the Americans were represented by ambassador W. Averell Harriman.

Eventually a breakthrough was achieved in early 1971, with the final agreement being signed on April 12.

Points of this program included a repudiation of the Democratic Party for failing to act on progressive issues like civil rights while bending to conservative interests. Instead the program provided for the establishment of a new socialist party, merging Sanders’ Liberty Union Party, Harrington’s Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee and several other parties like the Socialist Workers Party into the new American Party of Labor. Harrington would serve as the chairman of the party, with Chomsky taking an unofficial leadership role. Though they never ran in presidential elections, the APL would become a major force in American politics, entering the Senate and House of Representatives, winning several governorships and eventually playing a decisive role in the creation of the American People’s Commonwealth."

 decision_event.67.d:0 "The Great Lakes Confederation, a political union between three states in the Great Lakes region of America and the newly-formed government of North Michigan, which had seceded from the American People's Commonwealth controlled State of Michigan, was formed on July 12th, 1994, in Ottawa, Canada. The treaty that created the Confederation, known as the Ottawa Accords, was ratified and signed by Presidents of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and North Michigan, who had seen Canada as a stable third party to conduct diplomatic affairs in. Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III was appointed provisional president by the accords and was eventually officially inaugurated in a constitutional convention soon after. The accords also established the framework for the Great Lakes Confederation's legal and political system, modeled to give each state equal authority to quell fears of regional favoritism. The Ottawa Accords offically created large-scale autonomy within the boundaries of each state of the Confederation, as existing state legislatures, judicial systems, and even parts of the state constitutions continued to exist after the full ratification of the accords. Diplomatically, the Confederation was met with disapproval by the Midwest Union, who had allegedly been engaging in their own talks to integrate Iowa, and lukewarm obedience from the American People's Commonwealth, who legally dropped their claims on North Michigan in exchange for the Great Lakes Confederation doing the same for their Michigan territories. The Democratic Farmer-Labor Party under Humphrey would become the first ruling government of the Confederation until free and fair elections could finally be held in January of 1997."

Democratic Alliance candidate Paul Wellstone, Senator from Minnesota, defeated incumbent president Mark Neumann of Wisconsin and Libertarian perennial candidate Scott Boman. Neumann was popular among his party due to his uncompromisingly conservative presidential platform, but said platform also alienated many moderates and progressives in the Great Lakes, including his 1999 Unborn Child Protection Act and 2000 Economic Freedom Act. The Democratic Alliance, a newly-formed political bloc designed to unite leftists in the Great Lakes against Neumann's policies, had achieved victories in local elections across the country in 2000, and nominated party founder Paul Wellstone for President and Iowa firebrand Tom Harkin for Vice President. Boman swept the Libertarian nomination and campaigned mostly in opposition to Neumann's social reforms and in support of their own economic reforms, criticized as being extremely similar to the President's. With the Great Lakes' political establishment in a period of widespread chaos, Wellstone was able to capitalize on the failures of the Neumann government to adress the growth of terrorism and political instability across the country, along with erosions of the democratic process. Neumann severely damaged his candidacy when internal intelligence documents were leaked implicating him in staging the downfall of President Arne Carlson, which led to the relatively obscure Neumann becoming President in the first place. His reaction was no better, as he blamed the attack on splitters in the relatively unified Republican Party all the while unsuccessfully painting Wellstone as a Chomskyite authoritarian. As of 2010, Wellstone remains the candidate to achieve the highest share of the popular vote, defeating Neumann by a margin of 15.6% with strong showings in Minnesota and Iowa. It would also mark the worst performance for both the Republicans and the Libertarian Party in the history of the Great Lakes, though both parties significantly rebounded in later elections."

 decision_event.75.d:0 "The September War was a war between Chile and a coalition of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru. The war took place in September 1973 following the coup d’état that ousted Chile’s socialist president, Salvador Allende, and replaced the government with a military junta led by General Augusto Pinochet. In response, Argentina’s United Nations Ambassador Carlos Ortiz de Rozas condemned the coup in a speech to the United Nations on September 13, the day of the coup. Three days later, Argentine president Héctor Cámpora met with Soviet foreign minister Nikolai Patolichev and the left-wing presidents of Bolivia and Peru, Oscar Zamora Medinaceli and Juan Velasco Alvarado respectively, to plan a military operation to oust Pinochet and reinstate the previous government. The operation began on 19 September, after Pinochet failed to respond to the demands that the Chilean government junta be dissolved. The invasion consisted of a two-pronged attack, with most of the fighting taking place in northern Chile and around the Chilean capital of Santiago. The Peruvian Air Force disabled most of the Chilean Air Force during the first days of the war and successfully defeated the Chilean Army in the north while Argentina advanced on Santiago and surrounded the city. The war ended on October 7, 19 days after the initial invasion, as Peru captured the city of Copiapó and the remaining Chilean forces in the capital surrendered. Chile was occupied by Argentina, Bolivia and Peru while a transitional government led by Salvador Allende’s wife, Hortensia Bussi, was installed. The occupying powers would preside over the reorganization of the Chilean Armed Forces by Argentine advisors and the widely publicized trial and eventual execution of the coup leader Augusto Pinochet."

The elections occurred in the middle of President Ronald Reagan’s second term and were the last national elections held in the US before the Great American Collapse the following year. Despite being reelected by the House in 1985, President Reagan had been unable to push through any meaningful piece of legislation to tackle the ongoing economic crisis. He had effectively been a lame duck since 1983, and by 1986 his popularity had dropped to single digits. This galvanized the opposition from both the left and right, who geared up for the most decisive campaign in US history. The weeks leading up to the elections were marked by riots and political violence, with several radical groups clashing with each other. In the end no party emerged with a clear mandate. The Republicans were reduced to just 78 congressional seats, being surpassed in number by the Communist Party USA. The Democrats and Party of Labor came third and fourth respectively, with several smaller parties also picking up seats. Despite this the two old parties still retained control over the Senate and most governorships. In a bid to keep the Communists out of power, the Democrats, Labor and several third parties elected independent congresswoman LaDonna Harris as Speaker of the House, becoming the first native woman speaker in US history. The elections ultimately shattered any hope of recovery for the Reagan Administration, and the new congress would not even last a year before President Reagan dissolved the United States."

The official dissolution of the US was proclaimed by President Ronald Reagan on September 2, 1987, and was the culmination of several years of political turmoil beginning with the 1980 Economic Crisis and continuing through the disputed Presidential Election of 1984. Though coming to power on the promise of reform and an end to economic mismanagement, President Reagan had been unable to solve the political and economic issues that plagued the US, with subsequent elections rendering him even more powerless in the face of an increasingly oppositional congress and independent-minded governors. In what became known as the ‘long, hot summer of 1987’, the US was rocked by increasingly violent protests and riots, with the national death toll reaching double digits. Many feared civil war was inevitable, that socialists and communists would use the opportunity to take power by force. In response to the government’s declining power, Hawaii declared itself sovereign within the union on June 17, followed by Alaska on August 4. Unwilling or unable to reassert federal power over the states and fearful that such an action may be the catalyst for civil war, President Reagan called an extraordinary session of Congress on September 2. In an address to the nation as well as both houses of Congress, Reagan proclaimed the dissolution of the United States as a sovereign state, granting independence to all 50 states as sovereign republics. However the proclamation was never ratified by Congress, leading many, including Vice President George Bush, to argue that it was illegal. Both the European Spring and the Great Collapse marked the end of the Cold War."

In the impromptu proclamation Bush opened by invoking the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution, declaring that Reagan’s actions were equivalent to a resignation of the presidency, making Bush president by succession. The legality of this claim is still disputed by legal scholars. The self-proclaimed president then went on to denounce Reagan’s dissolution of the US, arguing that it was not approved by Congress and thus unconstitutional. Congress, however, had already effectively disbanded as many congress members were already on their way out of the city. This left very few politicians to support Bush in his efforts to prevent the dissolution of the union. With the situation in Washington, D.C. rapidly deteriorating, Bush secured the loyalty of the Pentagon and declared a state of emergency, putting the city under effective lockdown while calling for a constitutional settlement to the crisis. With the support of Reagan’s old cabinet, a few remaining members of congress and the loyalty of a few southern governors, Bush urged all those loyal to American ideals to go to Atlanta, where a ‘new republic’ was to be formed, encompassing all the territories held by the former United States. He then left the capital under effective military rule by Admiral William J. Crowe, until then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."

The revolution led to the unification of 15 former US states and two self-proclaimed communes under a socialist government, the American People’s Commonwealth. The movement which led to the revolution began as largely autonomous and decentralized, and followed from the anti-government protests which rocked the US in the summer of 1987. Major cities were hotspots of revolutionary activity, with a general strike in Chicago turning into a general revolt with the proclamation of the Chicago Commune by workers and activists on September 15, 1987. The newly independent states of the Northeast were divided on how to respond to the movement, with the largely moderate presidents often clashing with their more radical legislatures. Calls for unity came from former Vermont Governor Bernie Sanders, a leading member of the Party of Labor though still respected by many moderates in the former US. Together with Noam Chomsky, the unofficial leader of Labor, they gathered governors, politicians and activists in Philadelphia for a constitutional convention that would unite the states under a provisional government. Though the convention itself would last over two years and be marred by political infighting between socialist radicals, young activists and moderate politicians, it successfully unified the disparate states of the northeast and the Steel Belt, and restored political order by channeling the burgeoning revolutionary movement into the creation of the American People’s Commonwealth."

The convention was called in order to unite as many states as possible under a provisional government and to draft a new constitution for America, though the vision of this new constitution varied greatly between delegates. The first calls for unity had come from Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky, both socialist activists and representatives of the revolutionary social movement sweeping through the northeast. Supporters of the convention also came from moderate backgrounds, particularly progressive Democrats and independents. Michael Harrington, leader of the Party of Labor, would be elected the provisional president of the convention. Due to the president’s age, Chomsky would take on most of the responsibilities of the office, and he would eventually assume the position himself after the death of Harrington in 1989. The two year long convention was marred by factional disputes, both along ideological and sectional lines, and even the attempted secession of several states. The entry of many young socialists as delegates would eventually swing the convention in favor of the establishment of a non-partisan socialist federation, though not the kind Chomsky desired. Many of these young politicians would become key members of the Central Committee, and form part of what became known as the ‘New Guard’, while Chomsky’s allies and moderates would join together as the ‘Old Guard’. The final draft of the constitution was adopted on October 26, 1990, officially establishing the American People’s Commonwealth and electing Noam Chomsky as its first president."

The crisis involved a confrontation between the provisional government and the Republic of Rhode Island and Providence, as well as the states of New Hampshire and Maine. It ensued after the controversial adoption of Article V of the new constitution, which committed the provisional government to the transition to a socialist economy. Initially drafted by socialist activists, the article came to be supported by many moderates in the increasingly revolutionary political environment. Opposition was mostly concentrated in the conservative regions of northern New England, and the adoption of the article led Maine to withdraw their delegates from the constitutional convention on May 14, followed by New Hampshire and Rhode Island on May 22. President Edward DiPrete of Rhode Island became the figurehead of the attempted secession when he called for a new constitutional convention for New England, hoping to court moderate leaders like Mario Cuomo of New York and Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts. However, no other states joined the movement and neither Maine nor New Hampshire were fully committed to it, instead preferring independence or union with Canada. Both sides made military preparations, with Connecticut Governor Benjamin Spock purportedly ready to send his state’s national guard against Rhode Island. The crisis ended when DiPrete, realizing that no other states would join the secessionist movement, stepped down on August 3 to be replaced by Vice President Roger Begin, who announced Rhode Island’s commitment to the new constitution."

 decision_event.82.d:0 "The Constitution of the American People’s Commonwealth was adopted on October 26, 1990, after a two year-long constitutional convention. The constitution abolished the previous provisional government and replaced it with a socialist federal republic. Noam Chomsky, Victor Reuther, and sometimes Ted Kennedy are considered to be the primary co-authors of the document. In contrast to the old US constitution, the constitution of the APC explicitly rejects the concept of separation of powers, instead vesting the president with both executive and legislative powers. Instead of a congress, the commonwealth has the Central Committee, an appointed representative body which elects and advises the president on policies while also serving as an informal cabinet, similar to the Soviet Politburo. Due to the large responsibilities vested in the office of the president, many tasks are often delegated to sub-committees of the CC. The CC is appointed by the Trade Councils, industrial unions which represent all workers in the APC. The councils themselves are governed by their members, two from each state who are in turn appointed by the governors of each member state in the commonwealth. The governors are vested with expansive powers, including the right to appoint their own successors at the end of their term. This means that all governors in the commonwealth proceed from the initial 17 signatories of the constitution, and that there are no directly elected offices on the national or state level, only the local level. The elections that are open are officially non-partisan, with all candidates running as members of the Industrial Workers of the World, the labor union which came to supersede the Party of Labor as the largest political organization in the commonwealth."

The crisis was the culmination of several years of political turbulence, beginning with the election of Whitlam as prime minister in 1972. Despite holding a majority in the House of Representatives, the government was faced with a hostile Senate. Even after securing a double-dissolution election in 1974, Labor was unable to gain a majority in the Senate, and the government was only able to narrowly pass bills through a joint sitting of Parliament on August 6-7, 1974. In October 1975, the Opposition under Malcolm Fraser used their control of the Senate to block the passage of appropriation bills needed to finance government expenditure, demanding that Whitlam call a fresh election for the House of Representatives, and urging Governor-General Kerr to dismiss the Prime Minister if he did not accede to the demand. In an attempt to break the parliamentary deadlock, Whitlam went to seek Kerr’s approval to call a half-Senate election. Kerr did not accept the request, and on the advice of Chief Justice Garfield Barwick, dismissed Whitlam from the office of the Prime Minister, instead appointing Malcolm Fraser to the position. The new government acted quickly, before the ALP became aware of the dismissal, and urged the Governor-General to call a general election, in which Fraser and his Liberal-Country Coalition would be elected with a massive majority. The crisis is considered to be a major event in the leadup to the Australian Civil War of 1985-1988, as it established the precedent that the Governor-General may legally dismiss the Prime Minister, and contributed to the continuing enmity between the two government offices."

The alliance was first proposed by PCI leader Enrico Berlinguer in 1973, following the Chilean Coup D’état. Berlinguer believed that the Marxist left could not aspire to govern in democratic countries without establishing alliances with more moderate forces, and thus sought to ally the PCI with the ruling DC. The alliance was formalized in 1976, when Prime Minister Aldo Moro included Berlinguer in an emergency meeting that sought to avert the ongoing collapse of the Italian economy. That same year, the PCI began providing support for the conservative government of Giulio Andreotti, replacing DC’s traditional center-left allies like the Italian Socialist Party and the Italian Republican Party. This alliance became an official coalition in 1978, when veteran Socialist Sandro Pertini was elected President of Italy. The government is expected to resign upon the election of a new president, and Berlinguer pressured Pertini to appoint the PCI to the new government, the first time a western European communist party was included in a national government since the 1940s. The new government would last for over an entire term, and would preside over the European Economic Crisis, Italy’s crackdown on extremist terrorism, and the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, which caused a temporary break in relations between the PCI and Moscow. The Historic Compromise ended after the 1984 General Election, in which the PCI became the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, as DC was unwilling to continue the coalition as a minor party in a communist-led government."

The period is often considered to have begun in 1968, with the ‘68 protest movement, and the Hot Autumn strikes, which lasted from 1969 to 1970. Political violence increased over the following years, particularly assassinations. Common targets included students, police officers, judges and other officials, journalists and activists, often members of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement. Major events during this time include the Piazza Fontana bombing, which left 17 people dead, the Golpe Borghese, an attempted neo-fascist coup, the Piazza della Loggia bombing, which left 8 dead and 102 wounded, the attempted assassination of Prime Minister Aldo Moro, and the Bologna Masscare, which left 85 dead and over 200 wounded. The most prominent far-right organizations during this period were Ordine Nuovo, the National Vanguard and the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari, who perpetrated the Bologna Massacre, while the far-left included the Red Brigades, Prima Linea and Lotta Continua. These terrorist groups were gradually disbanded as their foreign support dried up and their leaders were arrested. A major blow to the far-left came in 1977, when the Soviet Union denounced terrorism as a way to achieve political change Europe. This caused the Czechoslovak State Security, the main supporters of the Red Brigades, to cut all ties with the organization. Sporadic violence would continue throughout the 1980s, and far-right terrorism would see a large resurgence after the elections of 1984 and 1985, beginning the ‘Anni Neri’, a period often considered to be a second Years of Lead."

The period is often considered to have begun after the election of the Italian Communist Party in 1984, and lasted until the mid-1990s. The first major case of political violence during this period was the assassination of communist Senator Armando Cossutta in 1984 by neo-fascist terrorists. Similar actions would be carried out during the coming decade, with the primary targets being officials, journalists, left-wing activists and police officers. The most significant attack during this period was the Palazzo Montecitorio bombing against a session of the Constituent Assembly, which left 12 dead, including four representatives, and 32 wounded. Following this attack, the Constituent Assembly released a parliamentary inquiry that alleged ties between several neo-fascist terrorist organizations and so-called ‘NATO stay-behind operations’, and that the attacks were organized or supported by parts of the Italian state with ties to the CIA. Further arrests were conducted, and after several high-profile court cases the Italian Military Intelligence and Security Service was disbanded in 1989. Following these revelations the violence gradually subsided, and it was determined that most neo-fascist groups had dissolved by 1996. Almost all arrests during the during this period were officials, not terrorists, leading many to warn that the terrorists were not gone, but just inactive. Subsequent inquiries, both parliamentary and judicial, into the nature and scale of these ‘stay-behind operations’ have been inconclusive."
