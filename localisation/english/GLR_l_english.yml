 ### FOCUSES ###
 GRL_referendum_ended:0 "The Referendum Concludes"
 GRL_referendum_ended_desc:0 "The referendum to restore the Great Lakes Confederation and the political turmoil related to it has finally ended, and the populace of the Great Lakes has decided to change the future of the nation for years to come. The coming weeks will decide the fate of the Hortman government and the nation as a whole."
 
 GRL_republican_victory:0 "Victory for the Republic"
 GRL_republican_victory_desc:0 "The "No" vote has triumphed in the referendum, and already the supporters of the Democratic Alliance have begun to take advantage of their newfound surge in support. It is time to cement the Republic in the lives of the people once and for all, so a true progressive future can commence under the rule of President Hortman."
 GRL_continue_the_hortman_presidency:0 "Hortman's Second Term"
 GRL_continue_the_hortman_presidency_desc:0 "President Hortman was first elected to power in the elections of 2005, and began her second term after the elections of 2009. With opposition politicians in the Democratic Alliance defeated, it is time to announce the platform for the coming years - one that will truly bring about a democratic socialist vision."
 GRL_centralize_the_executive:0 "Centralize The Executive"
 GRL_centralize_the_executive_desc:0 "Nationalists and militia-aligned politicians conspired to destroy the Great Lakes Republic during protests in support of the Confederation, and will surely do so again. If we ever are to secure a free and equal republic, measures must be taken to strengthen the President and defend the nation from threats both domestic and foreign."
 GRL_enshrine_secularism:0 "Enshrine Secular Principles"
 GRL_enshrine_secularism_desc:0 "The United States was founded on the principle of freedom of religion, a principle that should receive continued support in the Great Lakes Republic. With our right-wing opposition embracing hostile and divisive religious rhetoric, there is not a better time to remind them of the establishment clause of the first amendment."
 GRL_command_revolutionary_activists:0 "Command Revolutionary Activists"
 GRL_command_revolutionary_activists_desc:0 "Activism is a powerful tool to shape public opinion and galvanize support for certain policies. Although we will never support many of the IWW's radical proposals, aligning and controlling activists associated with their cause will surely bolster public and youth support for our policies."
 GRL_bolster_labor_unions:0 "Mass Unionization"
 GRL_bolster_labor_unions_desc:0 "The democratic socialists of the 20th century were never afraid to stand as bastions of the labor movement, and with striking and unionization more and more normalized, there is no reason why we should not follow in their footsteps. Against the abuses of capital, workers must be able to form and join protected and subsidized unions."
 GRL_control_the_vote_counters:0 "Control The Vote Counters"
 GRL_control_the_vote_counters_desc:0 "We cannot allow chaos and uncertainty around elections anymore. A slip up at any stage could mean collapse for the Alliance and collapse for the socialist project we’ve taken up to. We must sink our teeth into the electoral institutions of this Republic, and ensure that they prevent the victories of anyone looking to make a serious impact against us."
 GRL_a_party_of_the_democratic_left:0 "Of The Democratic Left"
 GRL_a_party_of_the_democratic_left_desc:0 "The results of our government’s work to improve the living conditions of every Great Laker will convince them to vote favorably during elections. Of course, this hands off approach is certainly more unreliable than simply controlling the vote, but it is the correct and democratic thing to do."
 GRL_cement_the_welfare_state:0 "Cement The Welfare State"
 GRL_cement_the_welfare_state_desc:0 "The welfare state is the centerpiece of our democratic socialism, and will be therefore institutionalized in the coming years. This is a slow, arduous process, but in the end it will be worth it. The people will be provided from cradle to grave everything that is necessary for them to flourish like healthcare, housing, and education. These shall be the focuses, but certainly not the full extent of securities we shall offer the people."
 GRL_nationalize_western_industry:0 "Nationalise Western Industry"
 GRL_nationalize_western_industry_desc:0 "Wisconsin leads the country in manufacturing capacity by far , but the western states are nonetheless still of industrial importance. To properly serve the people, they must be pried away from the hands of their greedy owners and taken into public ownership."
 GRL_finance_state_media:0 "Finance State Media"
 GRL_finance_state_media_desc:0 "From rabid far-tight tabloids to the official newspaper of the Libertarian Party, there are many sources that foster discontent and division within the Republic. While it would be risky to crack down against opposition media, we could drown them out by funding our own, from traditional sources like television channels and talk radio as well as online news. Well-funded media will serve to inform the public of the work of their government and to justify our rule."
 GRL_imprison_militia_leaders:0 "Imprison Militia Leaders"
 GRL_imprison_militia_leaders_desc:0 "The militias, those vicious heralds of fascism and racial supremacy, will need to be dealt with quickly and effectively. We can’t go on an all out purge against their members, but what we can do is arrest their leaders, whose locations we have firm and reliable intelligence on. We will put them on trial and let every hard-working man and woman know exactly who wants to destroy their hard earned equality."
 GRL_encourage_young_da_membership:0 "Encourage Young DA Membership"
 GRL_encourage_young_da_membership_desc:0 "The youth are an important part of any country’s politics, and we must secure their vocal and unassailable support through their inclusion in our party’s youth wing. We will work with leftist groups across the Republic and integrate them into the Young DA, as well as engage and encourage more to join our organization. The march towards equality must begin with those who are willing to take initiative."
 GRL_an_american_socialism:0 "An American Socialism"
 GRL_an_american_socialism_desc:0 "Since 2001, we have been building our own socialism, truly free and democratic, unlike that of the People's Commonwealth and People's Republics. The fruits of our labours are apparent to all, as we have created a shining beacon of equality and liberty in America. May this torch of red liberty shine forevermore!"
 GRL_ban_the_christian_peoples_party:0 "Ban The Christian People's Party"
 GRL_ban_the_christian_peoples_party_desc:0 "The Christian People's Party is a tool for the interests of militias and foreign politicians even more radical than Steve King, who has become a puppet of his own movement. For the good of democracy, it is time to shatter nationalist parties in the Great Lakes that continue to speak out against our fundamental democratic opportunities."
 GRL_crackdowns_in_iowa:0 "Crackdowns In Iowa"
 GRL_crackdowns_in_iowa_desc:0 "Iowa is a center of fascist militancy, and a general staging area for far right lunatics who want to tear down our democratic republic. We will answer with fire. Extremism has no place anywhere in our republic, and Iowa is no exception."
 GRL_depoliticize_the_police:0 "Depoliticise The Police"
 GRL_depoliticize_the_police_desc:0 "From the Soviet Union to the old United States, too often law enforcement has become a tool of a monstrous state, ready to comply with whatever demands their demagogic leaders issue of them. We will delink the police entirely from the process of politics and make it clear that their only job is to protect and serve the people. Corruption and brutality against minorities will be unacceptable of every department, whether they patrol the streets of Milwaukee or Minneapolis."
 GRL_cement_a_mixed_economy:0 "Cement A Mixed Economy"
 GRL_cement_a_mixed_economy_desc:0 "Even as we strive towards a more perfect, equal society, we mustn't forget the entrepreneurial spirit of the American people. While the natural monopolies and other essential sectors like telecommunications and banking must remain the domain of the state, we should yet permit private businesses within our Republic, to attain the best of both worlds."
 GRL_compromise_on_presidential_power:0 "Compromise On Presidential Power"
 GRL_compromise_on_presidential_power_desc:0 "We have worked long and hard to achieve success against the backdrop of a democratic system. By centralizing any more power with Hortman, we would betray the trust that millions of voters gave to our party and our President. We would become no better than the tyrants of Philadelphia and Los Angeles. To remain true to our name, the Democratic Alliance, is to remain true to the faith of our voters."
 GRL_commit_to_progressivism:0 "Commit To Progressivism"
 GRL_commit_to_progressivism_desc:0 "We are not socialists. Progressivism, the idea that reform and the positive changes it produces will bring society onwards for the benefit of all, is steeped in American history, endorsed by our greatest presidents, from Lincoln to the Roosevelts. We are not socialists, who repress dissent and make a mockery out of the values they claim to be fighting for."
 GRL_reform_the_healthcare_system:0 "Expand Socialized Healthcare"
 GRL_reform_the_healthcare_system_desc:0 "Solid, cradle-to-grave healthcare is an important part of any progressive agenda. We should expand government enrolment, while being careful about the intentions of the private companies and their political supporters."
 GRL_purge_corruption:0 "Purge Corruption"
 GRL_purge_corruption_desc:0 "We may be engaged in a just struggle against capitalist excess, and while our course is just, the Soviet example proves that a just cause can like any other be corrupted. We must make sure that those less dedicated among our ranks are removed from the equation, to ensure that we never stray from our path."
 GRL_reform_campaign_finance:0 "Reform Campaign Finance"
 GRL_reform_campaign_finance_desc:0 "In the old United States, corporations could dump millions into their favored candidates, completely distorting the will of the people. This blatantly undemocratic practice has continued since the collapse, so one of our first priorities will be to put an end to dirty money in politics. This issue is one with support from across the aisle, so let us pass it together under a united front for democracy."
 GRL_align_iww:0 "Align The IWW"
 GRL_align_iww_desc:0 "It has become increasingly clear that the revolutionary left, whether we like it or not, has become popular among the vast majority of our younger members. We could do a lot to quench their influence by aligning with the International Workers of the World, a union with many benefits to give if we declared our support for them, a coalition that would likewise reign them in and limit influence from Philadelphia."
 GRL_reassure_the_right:0 "Reassure The Party's Right"
 GRL_reassure_the_right_desc:0 "The moderates of the party are too numerous to risk driving away through an alliance with the IWW. Instead, the party will be focused on moderating its views to both attract the support of the wider population, and to reassure those who are anxious about our radical tendencies. Said tendencies will not be explicitly denounced for now, but quietly pushed back into the shadows, where they belong."
 GRL_encourage_immigration:0 "Encourage Immigration"
 GRL_encourage_immigration_desc:0 "The world is becoming a more uncertain place. Many suffer under the ruthless jackboot of Communism, and yearn for a better life of freedom and happiness. We may not be a major American state, but we are truly free, our citizens buoyed by guaranteed rights and a people's economy. We should encourage immigration to our republic from this continent and beyond, to let these tired, huddled masses live free."
 GRL_canadian_assistance:0 "Canadian Assistance"
 GRL_canadian_assistance_desc:0 "While we have made much progress rebuilding the Midwest from the damaeges of the American collapse, there is too much work for it to be handled alone. As such we will reach out to Canada, one of the last defenders of democracy left in the world, and request economic and military aid. This will be the first step to rekindle a fruitful relationship that has been neglected since Hortman’s first few years in office."
 GRL_the_minnesota_line:0 "The Great Minnesota Line"
 GRL_the_minnesota_line_desc:0 "The interstate highways used to be the pride of America, but the economic crises of the Cold War and then the collapse of the United States have left them neglected. We shall refurbish our small sections of it, from Minnesota to the borders, to improve connectivity within our republic and with our neighbours."
 GRL_champion_organized_labor:0 "Champion Organized Labor"
 GRL_champion_organized_labor_desc:0 "The union is the strongest protector of the worker. From the Knights of Labor to the Wobblies, unions have played a fundamentally positive role in the history of America; we will avoid the mistakes of past governments, by encouraging - not suppressing - the worker’s right to organize and join a group of their choice."
 GRL_condemn_revolutionary_socialists:0 "Condemn Revolutionary Socialism"
 GRL_condemn_revolutionary_socialists_desc:0 "The more radical wing of our party has caused a great deal of controversy, giving us an undeserved image as revolutionary extremists. Because of this, Hortman herself is planning to make some remarks about the IWW and other radical groups during her next scheduled interview on news television, which should get the message across to the people that we are not the radicals the right thinks we are."
 GRL_stand_for_the_environment:0 "Stand For The Environment"
 GRL_stand_for_the_environment_desc:0 "Governments across the Earth have shown that they are careless about the damaging impact their industry has wrecked upon it. As progressives, we are also environmentalists, and we will take a stand for our planet. We will not hesitate with enacting what policies are necessary to show our citizens that we care about the world in which we all live."
 GRL_strengthen_minority_rights:0 "Propose Affirmative Action"
 GRL_strengthen_minority_rights_desc:0 "Despite our commitment to economic equality, centuries of oppression have imprinted themselves upon our societal structures. There is only one way to undo that injustice, and that is through affirmative action. By extending additional opportunities to minority individuals throughout our Republic, we shall topple the first pillar of structural racism!"
 GRL_exile_militia_leaders:0 "Exile Militia Leaders"
 GRL_exile_militia_leaders_desc:0 "A ring of traitors yet remains among us. Too light a hand have the rebellious and reactionary militia leaders been treated with, but that ends today. And yet in our rightous punishment, we shall be merciful, merely deporting them from our borders. They shall be our problem no further."
 GRL_defenders_of_democracy:0 "Defenders Of Progressivism"
 GRL_defenders_of_democracy_desc:0 "Our hard-won freedoms from want and tyranny alike are now an inspiration to half a continent. But tyrants yet rear their ugly head in the Americas, ready and willing to undo all we have earned. We shall be prepared to defend our gains with not just words, but weapons. If need be, we will come to the defense of all who want to share our way of life."

 GRL_refine_our_foreign_policy:0 "Refine Our Foreign Policy"
 GRL_refine_our_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Despite our membership in the United Nations, few countries seek to establish serious relations with us, so as to not provoke the ire of the West Coast Communists. That needs to change. We shall pursue a more assertive foreign policy, to convince the nations of the world that we are a nation in our own right. The Foreign Office will be allocated more staff, in preparation for our new foreign doctrine."
 GRL_enter_the_democratic_league:0 "Enter The Democratic League"
 GRL_enter_the_democratic_league_desc:0 "Oh how lucky we are that the bulwark of democracy in the 21st century lies just across our northern border. An alliance with Canada would do much to safeguard our hard-won sovereignty from all who would dare threaten us. Let us petition them for membership, a foothold in the former United States would surely be appreciated."
 GRL_canadian_defence_contracts:0 "Hire Canadian Contractors"
 GRL_canadian_defence_contracts_desc:0 "Most formerly American defense companies have ended up relocating to Canada, leaving us with barren factories in need of reopening. Let us invite back our former defense contractors and refurbish their old factories, to ensure that our military may have the newest of equipment."
 GRL_canadian_technological_exchange:0 "Canadian Technological Exchange"
 GRL_canadian_technological_exchange_desc:0 "Canada hosts a vibrant R&D sector, and although we certainly have the industrial brawn, our industrial brains do on occasion leave a lot to be desired. Yet more aid from our new ally shall do just the trick that is needed to make the Great Lakes Republic the envy of the world."
 GRL_go_it_alone:0 "Reject Canadian Hegemony"
 GRL_go_it_alone_desc:0 "Canada may be a major power today, but that is indeed an issue. To introduce ourselves into the Canadian orbit would be detrimental to our sovereignty, and as a young nation, it is a most precious resource. Instead, we must seek to chart our own course, to truly assert our independence as a post-American state."
 GRL_occupy_illinois:0 "Occupy Illinois"
 GRL_occupy_illinois_desc:0 "Illinois is a minor republic at best, just waiting to be used as a springboard by one of the post-American pretenders. Its conquest would open up a soft underbelly to the heartland of our agricultural sector, and would thus be unacceptable. We must establish control over the Republic before someone else does, as a matter of national security."
 GRL_illinois_unification_talks:0 "Illinois Unification Summit"
 GRL_illinois_unification_talks_desc:0 "Like two lone islands in the ocean, our Republic and Illinois stand as the only democracies in a sea of chaos and dictatorship. Divided we may stand, and if it remains this way, divided we will fall. We must seek to stand together, for the sake of democracy in America."
 GRL_retake_our_territory:0 "Retake Our Territory"
 GRL_retake_our_territory_desc:0 "How can we call ourselves the [Root.GetName] when so much of the Great Lakes yet remain under the rule of the failed north-eastern state? We must not rest on our laurels, only when all the lands of the Great Lakes are under our flag can we once more be worthy of our name."
 GRL_apc_occupation_authority:0 "Commonwealth Occupation Authority"
 GRL_apc_occupation_authority_desc:0 "With the North East finally under our control, the time has come to decide the fate of the North East. We cannot possibly hope to govern them all, nor do we wish to signal to the other American states that we now too are a contender for reunification. Transitional states must be established, as a token of goodwill and to ease the burden on our administration."
 GRL_bailout_for_east_dakota:0 "Buy Out East Dakota"
 GRL_bailout_for_east_dakota_desc:0 "One of the many problems of the Midwest Union is the high debt incurred under recent administrations, while one of our problems is that we do not currently govern the legitimate western reaches of the Great Lakes states. Here is the opportunity for an excellent trade deal. We shall pay off some of their debt, and they shall restore onto us our rightful western border. Everything else is just a bonus."
 GRL_midwest_greatlakes_treaty:0 "Align Independent Democracies"
 GRL_midwest_greatlakes_treaty_desc:0 "Although the dream of a unified America is dead, it does not mean that we cannot yet build friendships with the other post-American states. The Midwest Union could be a capable ally with whom we can stand together against those that seek to turn this dead dream into a nightmare."
 GRL_detente_with_chomskys_commonwealth:0 "Detente With Philadelphia"
 GRL_detente_with_chomskys_commonwealth_desc:0 "It appears that our fears of the Philadelphia government are no longer valid. Noam Chomsky has at long last triumphed over his adversaries in the People's Commonwealth, and committed himself to peaceful coexistence. There is no reason not to take him up on his offer. A policy of detente towards the People's Commonwealth may at long last bury the hatchet of war between us."
 GRL_align_the_republic:0 "Align The Republic"
 GRL_align_the_republic_desc:0 "The dissolution of the United States were a mistake. Thankfully, President Bush did what he could to salvage the ship of state, and to this date, the South has kept the flame lit. We must align with [USA.GetLeader] and pledge ourselves to return to the fold when the time is right, so that the star-spangled banner may yet again wave from sea to shining sea."
 GRL_prepare_for_integration:0 "Prepare For Integration"
 GRL_prepare_for_integration_desc:0 "Reunification beckons! [USA.GetLeader] is working slowly but surely towards restoring order to this broken country, and we must find our place in this new order. Our administration must be prepared to deal with statehood once more, instead of being a sovereign republic. The first steps will be taken."
 GRL_republican_political_support:0 "Republican Political Meddling"
 GRL_republican_political_support_desc:0 "Subversive radicals are unfortunately dime a dozen in our lands, no doubt thanks to the pugnacious influences of Chomskyist Communism and the Hortman government. To ensure that integration runs as smoothly as possible, we must invite in some experts to make sure that these subversives are kept out from the halls of power, by any means necessary. A small price to pay for a whole America."
 GRL_an_era_of_prosperity:0 "A New Dawn For The Great Lakes"
 GRL_an_era_of_prosperity_desc:0 "Our foreign policy realignment has borne fruit, and now, the name of the [Root.GetName] is on everyone's lips. People know who we are and what we stand for. No more shall we be regarded as yet another post-American state, for we have taken up our rightful place on the world stage."
 GRL_ar_occupation_authority:0 "Remnants Occupation Authority"
 GRL_ar_occupation_authority_desc:0 "The South is under our heel, and like with the North East, we have no desire to annex that region. A military transitional government shall be formed, to ensure that a healthy democracy may yet soon take its shape in the South, as it has in the North."

 GRL_heal_from_the_collapse:0 "Heal From The Collapse"
 GRL_heal_from_the_collapse_desc:0 "The Midwest used to be the workshop of the world, but since the collapse, our industry has been neglected and fallen behind. As our government prepares its economic programmes, we must make sure that this is done with only the most modern of industry. Old factories will be refurbished and retraining made available for our workers."
 GRL_mixed_economic_vision:0 "Radical Minneapolis Economic Plan"
 GRL_mixed_economic_vision_desc:0 "Hesitation for implementing the full scope of our plans will only hinder their effects! If we are to truly build an economy that works for the people in the Midwest, we must enact the so-called 'radical' Minneapolis Plan. While there is nothing radical about improving the peoples' lives, we can certainly agree that it will bring radical improvement."
 GRL_nationalizing_the_steel_industry:0 "Continue Steel Nationalizations"
 GRL_nationalizing_the_steel_industry_desc:0 "Steel is the foundation upon which all modern civilisation is built. To leave that in private hands would be a foolish decision, as it would abandon this much-needed material in the chaotic whims of the market. All remaining steel mills must be brought under the control of the state, so that we shall never again run dry."
 GRL_expand_land_of_lakes_cooperative:0 "Support Land Of Lakes"
 GRL_expand_land_of_lakes_cooperative_desc:0 "We need not look to Philadelphia or Los Angeles for inspiration, for already in our own borders do workers own the means of production. The Land O'Lakes cooperative has for almost a century provided Americans with milk and cheese, without a single dime going to an unelected management. Let us support this beautiful Socialist example, so that it may expand its operations even further."
 GRL_urban_cooperative_expansion:0 "Urban Self-Management Expansion"
 GRL_urban_cooperative_expansion_desc:0 "Our nationalisation programme has removed the greedy hand of capital from the industry, but replacing the corporate boss with the state boss is not enough. Socialism can only truly be had when it is the working class who manage themselves, so it is high time give workers' self management a shot in some of our urban enterprises before extending it to the rest of the country."
 GRL_progressive_internationalism:0 "Progressive Internationalism"
 GRL_progressive_internationalism_desc:0 "Socialism is good, but to keep it within only our own borders would do the workers of the world a disservice. We should chart a bold, new trade policy, that will allow us to both support our democratically socialist comrades and show the benefits of Socialism to the rest."
 GRL_crush_military_monopolies:0 "Crush Private Military Monopolies"
 GRL_crush_military_monopolies_desc:0 "Given how the upper crust of society have already responded to our economic plans, it is not too far an assumption to make that they would do everything in their power to sabotage our government. For that reason, we cannot permit them to control our armaments industry, as that would undermine everything else that we have done so far. That sector will be brought under state control."
 GRL_continue_vital_nationalizations:0 "Continue Vital Nationalizations"
 GRL_continue_vital_nationalizations_desc:0 "The commanding heights of the economy must be in the hands of the state. That has been the key ingredient to every successful society in the 20th century and beyond. No stone shall be left unturned, no vital industry left to the whims of private interests, when we are done."
 GRL_dream_of_wellstone:0 "Wellstone's Legacy"
 GRL_dream_of_wellstone_desc:0 "The work that Paul Wellstone started in 2001 has at long last been completed. Here, on the banks of the Great Lakes, has a truly great society taken shape. Our people are secure in their needs, and nobody is missing a roof over their head or food in their stomach. May the sun shine forevermore on our land of the free, and home of the brave."
 GRL_moderate_economic_vision:0 "Moderate Minneapolis Economic Plan"
 GRL_moderate_economic_vision_desc:0 "Full equality is certainly an admirable ambition, but we should not push too hard. Many are still wary of state overreach, and perhaps there is wisdom to that worry. Instead, we should move slowly but surely, to ensure that the success of our reforms are not undone by radical ambition."
 GRL_urban_economic_focus:0 "Urban Economic Focus"
 GRL_urban_economic_focus_desc:0 "The cities are the beating hearts of our economy, from whence all of our wealth comes. Although urban development has certainly not been neglected, a long way to go yet remains, before we can say that are cities are truly shining upon a hill. This development must continue, to make Minneapolis and Milwaukee the greatest places to live in America."
 GRL_environmental_regulations:0 "Green Regulations"
 GRL_environmental_regulations_desc:0 "The Great Lakes are not what they used to be, with more than a century of industrial runoff polluting its environs. This is to the detriment of both our nature and our people, and thus cannot be accepted. Sweeping regulations must be enacted to ensure that there is a [Root.GetName] for our children and our grandchildren."
 GRL_model_industrial_centers:0 "Model Industrial Centers"
 GRL_model_industrial_centers_desc:0 "Although business is certainly picking up, there is still a long way to go before our economy can return to its former glory. With some targetted subsidies, we can help even more industries picking up the slack and making the gears of industry turn with unmatched speed in our lands."
 GRL_regulation_over_nationalization:0 "Regulation Over Nationalization"
 GRL_regulation_over_nationalization_desc:0 "State ownership does little to fix economic issues, and actually only manages to decrease economic efficiency. We would be much better served by simply regulating away the excesses of free enterprise than to bring the whole of enterprise under our control. That way, we can maintain workers' protections without needlessly restricting our economy."
 GRL_work_with_defense_companies:0 "Work With Defense Companies"
 GRL_work_with_defense_companies_desc:0 "It would be foolish to antagonise those that keep our guns greased and our armies fed just because of some misplaced ideological sentiment. Instead, we must help them reestablish themselves on our shores, and make sure they have what they need to keep their businesses going. What helps them helps us."
 GRL_fight_for_full_employment:0 "Fight For Full Employment"
 GRL_fight_for_full_employment_desc:0 "The scourge of unemployment is one plaguing every industrial society, leaving scores of people unable to experience the dignity of good, honest work. The state must step in and offer quality employment for all who wants it. If it worked for Roosevelt, it will work for us as well."
 GRL_humanitarian_aid_programs:0 "Humanitarian Aid Programs"
 GRL_humanitarian_aid_programs_desc:0 "We can't ignore the plight of the least fortunate in our society. To do so would be inhumanity more befitting of the Republic or Montana. A strong safety net must be established to catch those that fall through the crack and become unable to care for themselves."
 GRL_humphreys_vision:0 "Humphrey's Dream"
 GRL_humphreys_vision_desc:0 "One of the dearest sons of our home has been Hubert Humphrey, who dreamed of an America free from poverty. Although America may be gone, his dreams did never pass far from our awareness, and now, we may be certain that if Hubert was still among us, he would be proud of what we have accomplished."
 GRL_capitalist_economic_vision:0 "Traverse City Economic Plan"
 GRL_capitalist_economic_vision_desc:0 "The socialist course that we have gone down the last decade has done nothing but limit American freedom. The time has come to reverse course, and to once more let loose the entrepreneurial spirit of America that is sure to make wealth trickle down to us all!"
 GRL_prioritize_productivity:0 "Prioritize Productivity"
 GRL_prioritize_productivity_desc:0 "Wealth cannot be gained by just sitting around and twiddling thumbs. No, it must be worked for, by the sweat of one's brow. We will incentivise greater productivity by cutting a few taxes and removing some unnecessary 'workers' rights' legislation that do nothing but strangle the bold entrepreneurs of our nation."
 GRL_encourage_homemade_industry:0 "Encourage Homemade Industry"
 GRL_encourage_homemade_industry_desc:0 "Why buy from abroad when you can buy Great Laker? With some targetted tariffs and some reminders to our people about the inferiority of socialist goods from the Commonwealth, we can ensure that industry in the Lakes will thrive once more."
 GRL_international_self_sufficiency:0 "International Self-Sufficiency"
 GRL_international_self_sufficiency_desc:0 "A dependency on other countries is a vital artery that can be cut off by the Socialists surrounding us. We shall not leave our businesses at the whims of the tyrants in Philadelphia. Everything that can be sourced at home will be sourced at home, by extending our trade barriers and enacting sweeping protectionist laws."
 GRL_corporate_synthesis:0 "Corporate Policy Synthesis"
 GRL_corporate_synthesis_desc:0 "The businessman is the pinnacle of patriotism, for he rolls up his sleeves and dedicates his life to enriching us all. A more noble spirit is hard to find. Let us meet with these benevolent titans of industry to figure out their needs, so that we may secure them the ideal conditions for their work."
 GRL_align_resource_conglomerates:0 "Align Resource Conglomerates"
 GRL_align_resource_conglomerates_desc:0 "Our soil holds a veritable wellspring of wealth, one that we would be foolish to just leave in the ground. We have the natural resources, and the Canadian resource conglomerates have the expertise needed to extract them. We can gain a very lucrative agreement by aligning them."
 GRL_restoration_of_michigan:0 "Restore North Michigan"
 GRL_restoration_of_michigan_desc:0 "Michigan used to be the heart of the American automotive industry, but economic crises and later the Socialist coup have firmly relegated that status to the past. No more! We shall rebuild in the north of Michigan an industrial network that will make the Communists in Detroit green with envy, showcasing the efficiency of Capitalism to our southern neighbours."
 GRL_fords_ideals:0 "Ford's Vision"
 GRL_fords_ideals_desc:0 "An economy is like a machine, and like a machine, it may only move if the gears and creases are unobstructed. We have cut out the Socialist red tape so unfairly imposed upon our business and now, every gear in our economy hums with efficiency. Fordism is no longer a business practice but an engine for the prosperity of all of the [Root.GetName]!"

 GRL_confederal_victory:0 "Victory For The Confederation"
 GRL_confederal_victory_desc:0 "The "Yes" vote has triumphed in the Referendum, and already the supporters of the President have begun to abandon her rule and that of the party. It is time for President Hortman to officially tender her resignation from the office of commander-in-chief, and leave the post open for a new leader."
 GRL_minneapolis_conference:0 "The Minneapolis Conference"
 GRL_minneapolis_conference_desc:0 "The Republic has become deeply unpopular, and the legacy of unitary governance will surely tarnish our party in future elections. Minneapolis, the heart of working class activity in the Republic, is one of the only cities with enough confederation supporters to hold a viable leadership election. Two prominent politicians from the region shall run, and hopefully save our party."
 GRL_snap_elections:0 "Call Snap Elections"
 GRL_snap_elections_desc:0 "Congress is in chaos and the popularity of the Democratic Alliance is quickly declining. It is necessary that we call snap elections quickly, lest the presidency of [Root.GetLeader] collapse completely to our opposition. Libertarians, nationalists, republicans, and socialists all will vie for control of the Confederation - let us hope that our government can emerge triumphant."
 
 GRL_president_fletcher:0 "The Fletcher Presidency"
 GRL_president_fletcher_desc:0 "Community organizer and Representative from the Twin Cities Steve Fletcher has arisen to the presidency as one of the few supporters of the Confederation in the Democratic Alliance. Although his proposals may be radical and his ties with the IWW worrying, none can doubt his commitment to social and economic justice.\nTo President Fletcher!"
 GRL_meet_with_chomsky:0 "Approach Philadelphia"
 GRL_meet_with_chomsky_desc:0 "The Commonwealth has built a prosperous socialist society, and although its authoritarian political system is clearly not one to emulate, their economic and social achievements are spectacular. President Fletcher should visit the city and learn from the best and the brightest [NEA.GetLeader] and their allies have to offer."
 GRL_heal_urban_communities:0 "Heal Urban Communities"
 GRL_heal_urban_communities_desc:0 "Urban communities have been left behind by our government, and despite the progressive reforms of Hortman and Wellstone, poverty, drug use, and racially segregated areas are still widespread. We must conduct a major infrastructure and revitalization program for these troubled areas."
 GRL_sponsor_cooperatives:0 "Sponsor Cooperatives"
 GRL_sponsor_cooperatives_desc:0 "To truly establish Socialism in the Great Lakes, the answer does not lie solely in nationalisation and expropriation. We must also give the people the tools they need in order to bring about Socialism of their own accord. Through generous grants and sponsorships, we can both help workers buy out their capitalist businesses and establish new cooperatives, allowing Socialism to grow from the grassroots as well."
 GRL_hike_income_taxes:0 "Hike Income Taxes"
 GRL_hike_income_taxes_desc:0 "Successive governments have done well to dismantle the moneyed classes, but many yet remain, engorging themselves on ill-begotten wealth. Another fierce blow must be struck! By increasing the income tax, and levying further taxes on the remaining super-rich and on private businesses, we may finish the fight and at long last squeeze out the remaining upper-class resistance."
 GRL_bend_to_the_iww:0 "Strengthen The Coalition"
 GRL_bend_to_the_iww_desc:0 "The Democratic Alliance and IWW must band together for freedom, democracy, and progress in the Great Lakes. Further integration of the presidential and parliamentary coalition into an official electoral alliance will make sure our parties cannot threaten eachother in swing seats but also ward off liberal outrage over a full merger."
 GRL_legalize_communist_party:0 "Legalize Communist Organizations"
 GRL_legalize_communist_party_desc:0 "Authoritarian socialism is a plague, but far-left activism has always been a beneficial tool to ensure economic justice. With most of our major communist figures taking an anti-UAPR stance, and the fears of a communist revolution gone, the Fletcher government shall reconcile with organizations marginalized and crushed by the rise of the Great Lakes Confederation in the 1990s."
 GRL_iowa_revitalization_plan:0 "Iowa Revitalization Plan"
 GRL_iowa_revitalization_plan_desc:0 "Iowa may be a hotbed of conservatism, but it is still part of our confederation and thus our responsibility. With some infrastructure programmes, we will boost the local economy, help the local farmers and maybe prove to the Iowans that the government maybe can be their friend after all."
 GRL_michigan_revitalization_plan:0 "Michigan Revitalization Plan"
 GRL_michigan_revitalization_plan_desc:0 "Michigan was hit hard by being split down the middle, with the north suddenly cut off from the south. But thanks to the increase of cross-border trade since President Fletcher's election, we may have an ample opportunity to revitalise the Michigan and once more make it an industrial powerhouse."
 GRL_placate_activists:0 "Placate Activists"
 GRL_placate_activists_desc:0 "African-American, young, and socialist activists have the right ideas about our society, and it is important that we let the movement know we are fighting for, not against them. Vice President Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, with Fletcher's blessing, will attend rallies and speeches in Milwaukee to work with these patriots to bring about our shared interests."
 GRL_abandon_the_republican_dream:0 "Abandon The Republican Dream"
 GRL_abandon_the_republican_dream_desc:0 "The Republic is dead, and the people have voted for the Confederation once more. Any mention of restoring and centralizing the Republic should temporarily be removed from both the DA's official platform and our party's rhetoric, lest we lose too many votes because of it."
 GRL_target_the_cpp:0 "Target The Christian People's Party"
 GRL_target_the_cpp_desc:0 "The Christian People's Party is nothing more than a disgusting front organisation for Fascists and terrorists, led by the arch-reactionary Steve King. As outlawing them would be in violation of their democratic rights, let us simply marginalise them through propaganda and legal investigation of their ties to the far right."
 GRL_community_outreach_programs:0 "Expand Community Outreach Programs"
 GRL_community_outreach_programs_desc:0 "The police exist to serve the people and should always be in touch with the people. Community policing is the way to go, for it ensures that the never again becomes a blunt instrument of violence for those in power. Rebuilding the people's trust in the police is the first step towards a more harmonious society."
 GRL_housing_for_all:0 "Housing For All"
 GRL_housing_for_all_desc:0 "Housing is an oft-neglected human right, as people are relegated to cope with the whims of greedy landlords or mortgage loans. Human rights should not be left at the mercy of the free market, that would be a travesty.

 GRL_fletcher_decarceration_initiative_desc:0 "All too many people are locked up for overly harsh sentences, or worse, imagined crimes as a result of structural racism. Merely reforming the police would be a disservice to those already imprisoned by police injustice. The Department of Justice will be ordered to sift through the many criminal cases and reevaluate who deserved their punishments and who were locked up unjustly."

 GRL_a_vision_of_justice_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Confederation may not the the Republic that the Democratic Alliance originally envisioned, but it is undeniable that we have transformed it into a more just society.

 GRL_president_hodges_desc:0 "Recently-inaugurated Mayor of Minnesota and staunch loyalist to the party's Hortmanite wing Betsy Hodges has arisen to the presidency as one of the few supporters of both the former President and the Confederation in the Democratic Alliance. A champion of unity, fairness, and freedom, Hodges will not waver in her convictions.\nTo President Hodges!"

 GRL_bring_back_the_base_desc:0 "As much as it pains many in the DA to say, urban liberals are not the future of this party, nor the base that will propel us to the victories of 2001 and 2005 again. The populist farmer in Iowa, the struggling worker in rural Michigan, and the traditionalist laborer of Minnesota may be bigots or conservatives at heart, but they must be swayed to join us once more."
 GRL_target_the_republicans:0 "Target The Republicans"
 GRL_target_the_republicans_desc:0 "The Christian People's Party will become irrelevant in a couple years, and our real enemy shall yet again become the Republican Party.

 GRL_repurpose_hortman_police_plan:0 "Repurpose Hortman's Police Plan"
 GRL_repurpose_hortman_police_plan_desc:0 "As the former Mayor of Minnesota, President Hodges understands the value of police reform in the pursuit for racial and social justice. Hortman's Police Action Plan, cut short by her resignation, will be repurposed and expanded, so that law enforcement can be properly regulated and the people of the Great Lakes can once again feel safe."
 GRL_infrastructure_across_the_nation:0 "Infrastructure Across The Nation"
 GRL_infrastructure_across_the_nation_desc:0 "The people need to see our commitment to their common wellbeing. Many communities across the Great Lakes have seen little improvement since the fall of the United States, but should not be left behind. Roads will be repaved, buildings restored, our citizens shown that the government still cares for them."
 GRL_expand_urban_health_programs:0 "Expand Urban Healthcare Programs"
 GRL_expand_urban_health_programs_desc:0 "Mental health, poverty, and drugs are all problems that grip our urban communities, even after 10 years of leftist rule.

 GRL_unify_the_party:0 "Unify The Party"
 GRL_unify_the_party_desc:0 "Recent events have sown seeds of division in the Democratic Alliance, some that risk splitting the party entirely. With disagreements over confederation and the extent of reforms aplenty, it is imperative that we form a commission to charter a new platform, one that we may all stand together around, to ensure that our alliance continues to stand."
 GRL_strict_fiscal_discipline:0 "Strict Fiscal Discipline"
 GRL_strict_fiscal_discipline_desc:0 "Leftist governments around the world have unfortunately acquired an ill-deserved as spendthrifts, one that the conservatives keep hammering home against our government again and again. This rhetoric must be blunted, as our government shall observe the strictest of fiscal disciplines. Our activists may be understandably disheartened by this, but our careful approach will prove itself in time."
 GRL_expand_public_universities:0 "Expand Public Universities"
 GRL_expand_public_universities_desc:0 "Education is the foundation upon which we will build our future, and already our universities are doing their part.

 GRL_women_are_the_future_desc:0 "It is said that the last 2000 years have belonged to men, but that the next 2000 ones will belong to women.

 GRL_youth_are_the_future_desc:0 "Few are as driven and passionate for a better future than the youth. Forming the core of our activist groups, its is thanks to their tireless work that we are in power.

 GRL_perfect_the_confederal_transition_desc:0 "The days of the Republic are behind us, that is as clear as day.

 GRL_work_with_the_establishment:0 "Work With The Establishment"
 GRL_work_with_the_establishment_desc:0 "Hodges may be a maverick, but that doesn't mean that she'll cast aside her allies for her own goals. With a tent as broad as ours, it is imperative to keep the Unity Commission around, to ensure that all factions within the party are sated."
 GRL_hodgesism:0 "Enshrine Hodgesism"
 GRL_hodgesism_desc:0 "When her presidency was in its infancy, Besty Hodges created a DA unity commission to restore a shared sense of progressive ideology within the party. Now, however, the goals of the commission have been accomplished, and its purpose has vanished. Hodges shall follow in the spirit of Wellstone, and cement herself as an independent visionary."
 GRL_renew_the_nation:0 "Renew The Nation"
 GRL_renew_the_nation_desc:0 "We have hit a rough patch, and emerged stronger for it. The Great Lakes Confederation is boldly striding forwards, the mistakes of the past slowly but surely being mended. President Hodges has done well in saving both the country from its social ills, and saving our party from electoral irrelevancy. Renewal has come to the Great Lakes, and borne prosperity with it."

 GRL_president_ventura:0 "The Ventura Presidency"
 GRL_president_ventura_desc:0 "Mayor of Brooklyn Park and briefly Governor of Minnesota before the position was abolished by the unitary republicans, Jesse Ventura has become leader of the Libertarians and now the Confederation in only a year.

 GRL_look_to_the_left:0 "Look to the Left"
 GRL_look_to_the_left_desc:0 "Ventura has won the presidency, but his victory has not exactly translated into libertarian control of Congress. If we are to pass through relevant legislation, we must gain support, and for our broad agenda of personal liberty and social progress, who better than the populists of the DA?"
 GRL_strengthen_the_entitlements:0 "Preserve the Entitlements"
 GRL_strengthen_the_entitlements_desc:0 "Although not in the Libertarian orthdoxy, it is clear that it would be better to preserve and rationalise the entitlements than to abolish them altogether. With some targeted cuts, we can trim some of the fat from the welfare state while preserving what the needy receive, allowing us to maintain the equality of opportunity that characterises our Confederation."
 GRL_radical_centrism:0 "Radical Centrism"
 GRL_radical_centrism_desc:0 "Any agreement of confidence and supply would destroy our credibility as an independent centrist force opposed to the duopoly of the Republicans and the Democratic Alliance. We must listen our base and our party, and refuse compromise at any basis other than a simple case-by-case agenda."
 GRL_crush_the_militias:0 "Crush The Militia Movement"
 GRL_crush_the_militias_desc:0 "There is a cancer in our midst. Holding only disdain for our freedoms and democracy, the militia movement are dangerous radicals, whom previous governments have neglected to act against. As Karl Popper said, one must not tolerate the intolerant, and while freedom of association is always important, these Fascists must find a way to associate that does not put liberty at risk. We shall make sure of that."
 GRL_attack_union_corruption:0 "Attack Union Corruption"
 GRL_attack_union_corruption_desc:0 "Although the right to organise is paramount in a free society, some organisations have lost their way. The trade unions have forgotten those whom they claim to represent, and have instead become but an extension of Chomskyist dictatorship, growing fat and corrupt off of the dues their hard-working members are paying with nary a consequence. These lumbering beasts must no longer obstruct us."
 GRL_listen_to_the_right:0 "Listen to the Right"
 GRL_listen_to_the_right_desc:0 "Ventura is the first non-leftist to hold the office of president since the declaration of the Great Lakes Republic. Instead of placating leftists and allowing them to take credit for our agenda, we must move to the right, and cooperate with the Republicans and the CPP on matters of economic conservatism and natural rights."
 GRL_target_immigration:0 "Target Immigration"
 GRL_target_immigration_desc:0 "The Hortman Government's policy of open borders have undermined our country, allowing illegals and socialist agitators alike to slip into the country. We will not oppose immigration, merely those that come here unregistered. As a concession to our Republican partners, we will tigthen immigration control, ensuring that only those who come here legally may stay."
 GRL_no_more_gangs_in_government:0 "No More Gangs in Government"
 GRL_no_more_gangs_in_government_desc:0 "Nine years of Hortman has ensured that a lot of her appointees have become awfully comfortable on their government salaries, forgetting that they are to serve the people, not themselves. A reminder is in order, as we shall audit these DA government gangsters, and if they are found to have been corrupt, they will need to find employment elsewhere."
 GRL_military_for_defense:0 "Military for Defense"
 GRL_military_for_defense_desc:0 "One of the things that broke the old United States was unbridled military aggression, as Washington thought it could intervene wantonly in other countries internal affairs. With such a foreign policy, it is no wonder that the world went straight into the arms of Moscow. We shall never again commit the same mistake, and pledge that we shall only use our military for defense, never to attack."
 GRL_break_the_gun_laws:0 "Break Gun Control"
 GRL_break_the_gun_laws_desc:0 "'The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed', or so the old Constitution went.

Only if we allow our people to truly keep and bear the arms that they opt to can we remain a free state."
 GRL_end_oppressive_regulations:0 "End Oppressive Regulations"
 GRL_end_oppressive_regulations_desc:0 "Our people are almost literally being strangled in red tape, restricting their rights and privileges of free people of our confederation.

 GRL_bastion_of_cultural_liberalism:0 "Cultural And Social Liberalism"
 GRL_bastion_of_cultural_liberalism_desc:0 "As we work to form a more free society, we should not forget those ensnared not by government regulation, but also by outdated social mores. Standing up for racial minorities and the LGBTQ community is essential for a libertarian society, as we cast aside outdated dogma that keeps people from living the lives they truly wish to live."
 GRL_stand_for_minority_rights:0 "Social Freedom Focus"
 GRL_stand_for_minority_rights_desc:0 "Attempting economic idealism now would only throw a wrench in the gears of all we have done so far. Despite what certain libertarian radicals would tell you, we can't just privatize everything and call it a day. As our economic plans slowly continue, let us make an impact where we truly can, in the field of social politics. The last vestiges of outdated legislation shall be swept away, to complete emancipation."
 GRL_hands_off_social_issues:0 "Sideline Social Issues"
 GRL_hands_off_social_issues_desc:0 "It is clear that the presence of the greatest tyranny in our day is that in the field of economics. While well-meaning activists are pushing for social progressivism, the attention of our government must respond to the greatest needs of our society. Only with a free economy may we have a free society."
 GRL_focus_on_capitalism:0 "Economic Freedom Focus"
 GRL_focus_on_capitalism_desc:0 "Starting a business in the Great Lakes is notoriously difficult, thanks to the socialist regulations of the former government. If we are not the best place for business in America by the time Ventura's term ends, then our government has failed. Red tape and regulation should be swept away, allowing the businesses that fund our society to thrive at long last."
 GRL_peoples_tax_rebate:0 "A People's Tax Rebate"
 GRL_peoples_tax_rebate_desc:0 "It is silly to run a surplus if all the good that's going to do is put money into the treasury. Instead, let us lessen the burden of taxation, and give out generous rebates to the people to give back what they have rightfully earned with the sweat of their brow."
 GRL_fight_media_jackals:0 "Fight Media Jackals"
 GRL_fight_media_jackals_desc:0 "Despite all we have done for the Great Lakes, it has never been enough. From the beginning, corporate media has called for more, more, criticising our reasonable and rational approach to economic freedom. It is now clear that what they seek is not economic freedom, but to merely supplant the socialist hegemony. President Ventura cannot let that stand, and he will show their true character for all to see!"
 GRL_stand_for_the_indigenous:0 "Stand for the Indigenous"
 GRL_stand_for_the_indigenous_desc:0 "Before we were here, the Native Americans were here, and when their lands were violently taken away from them, they were unjustly forced into reservations, seemingly just to rot away. This injustice must be dealt with. President Ventura shall meet with native community leaders, and at long last restore justice for this long-overlooked group of Americans."
 GRL_green_libertarianism:0 "An Ecological Libertarianism"
 GRL_green_libertarianism_desc:0 "What measure is a free life if spent in smog and pollution? Our beautiful woods and lakes must be protected. While the free hand is the guide of the economy, it might not hurt to help it along its way. We should grant tax credits for businesses that do their utmost to safeguard the environment, and fine those that disregard it the most."
 GRL_liberty_and_justice_for_all:0 "Liberty and Justice for All"
 GRL_liberty_and_justice_for_all_desc:0 "Never before has the Great Lakes lived and breathed so freely. President Ventura has cut away many of the restrictions and regulations that have governed the peoples' lives, and ensured that we can finally say that we have formed a more perfect confederation, with liberty and justice for all."

 GRL_president_devos:0 "The DeVos Presidency"
 GRL_president_devos_desc:0 "Many thought the Republican Party of the Great Lakes resigned to the dustbin of history when Paul Wellstone won his landslide victory in 2001, but such was not the case. Under the exceptional leadership of Betsy DeVos in the face of socialist and nationalist opposition, conservatism in the Great Lakes has survived, and now, it shall thrive.\nTo President DeVos!"
 GRL_prince_family_ties:0 "Strengthen Prince Family Ties"
 GRL_prince_family_ties_desc:0 "Erik Prince is not just the brother of President DeVos, but also a leading private military contractor. As we prepare to strengthen our brave armed forces, his experience would be invaluable in helping us shed the legacy of Hortmanite Socialism. Together, we may ensure that freedom shall persist in the Great Lakes for decades to come!"
 GRL_crush_conservative_mutinies:0 "Crush Conservative Mutinies"
 GRL_crush_conservative_mutinies_desc:0 "The Conservative cause in the Great Lakes has unfortunately been hampered by defections and internal splits for years now, letting the socialist Democratic Alliance run roughshod over our country. If we are to persevere, we need to coalesce. We'll meet with the leadership of the other Conservative parties, in order to bring us all back under one roof."
 GRL_strengthen_congress:0 "Strengthen Our Congressional Hold"
 GRL_strengthen_congress_desc:0 "Our hold over Congress needs to be strengthened if we are to succeed. We need to not just reach out to right wing Libertarians and... agreeable members of the Christian People's Party, but also ensure that any future redistricting happens in a manner that serves the conservative cause. Only that way can we guarantee freedom for America."
 GRL_humiliate_the_cpp:0 "Humiliate The CPP"
 GRL_humiliate_the_cpp_desc:0 "With true conservatives in office, Steve King's crypto-fascist political resistance to both the Republican establishment and the DA can finally come to an end. Political wrangling from DeVos will make sure most of his loyal congressmen will soon jump ship from his tattered banner, and King's own political career will end with a whimper."
 GRL_high_grade_military_development:0 "High-Grade Military Development"
 GRL_high_grade_military_development_desc:0 "Our brave soldiers need only the best of the best, nothing less will be satisfactory. With our great nation covering parts of America's old industrial heartland, we can ensure that our brave troops have access to the best of the best, if we just support the Military-Industrial Complex in refurbishing some old factories. "
 GRL_anti_communist_mercenaries:0 "Anti-Communist PMCs"
 GRL_anti_communist_mercenaries_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Commonwealth is unfortunately not a densely populated country, and with our largest neighbour outnumbering us almost ten to one, it is essential that we find another way to bolster our numbers. Drawing upon Erik Prince once more, we can for just a little cash fill out the gaps in our ranks, to ensure that the Great Lakes shall never fall."
 GRL_desocialization:0 "Begin The Desocialization Process"
 GRL_desocialization_desc:0 "The Democratic Alliance sank its claws deep into our country, gripping it with their socialistic policies and legitimising even worse forces, like the IWW. We must remove their influences to save our country, and although banning them would violate our most sacred democratic rights, we can certainly investigate corruption in their ranks and their trade union allies. For the good of the Great Lakes."
 GRL_begin_deregulation_process:0 "Deregulation For Business"
 GRL_begin_deregulation_process_desc:0 "How can our businesses thrive when they are being strangled by socialist regulations? These are not just detrimental to our economy, but to the very concept of freedom itself. Untangling them all will take time, but must be done, so that free enterprise can return to the shores of the Great Lakes once more."
 GRL_revitalize_private_schools:0 "Revitalize Private Schooling"
 GRL_revitalize_private_schools_desc:0 "For years, parents have not been able to make their own choices for the education of their children. Instead, that decision has been left for the local school districts, preventing parents from making the right choice for their child. Private schooling, neglected since the late 80s, is the remedy for this problem, and so we must offer them support and get them back on their feet."
 GRL_bring_back_vouchers:0 "Bring Back Vouchers"
 GRL_bring_back_vouchers_desc:0 "The greatest way to ensuring educational freedom in our country is not just to bring back private schools, but to instate a school voucher system. This would allow parents to freely pick any school of their choosing for their children, both public and private, without having to worry about costs. Letting public and private schools compete this way is certain to raise up all schools across the country."
 GRL_the_freedom_to_choose:0 "The Freedom To Choose"
 GRL_the_freedom_to_choose_desc:0 "The welfare state, although extolled by Socialists as a 'necessity to help the weakest in society', is actually yet another means of government overreach. Ensnaring its recipients in a dormant lifestyle of receiving the dole, it puts the recipients at the mercy of the government, instead of encouraging them to find work and taking care of themselves. Freedom cannot ring in the Great Lakes so long as it persists."
 GRL_vice_presidents_plan:0 "The Vice President's Plan"
 GRL_vice_presidents_plan_desc:0 "Scott Walker, Vice President to Betsy DeVos, has achieved political primacy within the Great Lakes Confederation, bolstered by close cooperation with the commander-in-chief. Both long-time corporate republican politicians, Walker and DeVos will no doubt pursue further capitalistic reforms now that threats to their rule have fizzled out."
 GRL_repeal_campaign_finance_reform:0 "Repeal Feingold Campaign Reforms"
 GRL_repeal_campaign_finance_reform_desc:0 "The Feingold Campaign Reforms, though certainly well intentioned, have only served to subvert our democracy, by restricting how loyal patriots can donate to the campaigns that they support. This has also had the effect of limiting the amount of funds available to candidates, preventing them from properly mounting their campaigns. Only with a total repeal may we fix this democratic deficiency."
 GRL_a_republican_military_budget:0 "A Republican Military Budget"
 GRL_a_republican_military_budget_desc:0 "The Republican Party have always been at the forefront of defense, ready to face Communism at home and abroad. Unfortunately, the Democratic Alliance has neglected our national defence in favour of their numerous blue sky programmes. With a significant increase in revenue from our cuts to said programmes, we can afford to give the military a major funding boost, as they rightfully deserve."
 GRL_return_of_corporate_republicanism:0 "Return Of Corporate Republicanism"
 GRL_return_of_corporate_republicanism_desc:0 "There are few things as American as Capitalism. While they've hitherto been unfairly demonised, it is high time we realise that big business are not our foes, but our friends. We should re-establish our ties with these most successful capitalists."
 GRL_mccarthy_vindicated:0 "McCarthy Vindicated"
 GRL_mccarthy_vindicated_desc:0 "As we stand here, about sixty years after his great crusade against Communism, it is apparent to all that McCarthy was right.

They cannot hide from us forever."
 GRL_defense_secretarys_plan:0 "The Defense Secretary's Plan"
 GRL_defense_secretarys_plan_desc:0 "Jack Bergman, Secretary of Defense in the DeVos administration, has achieved political primacy within the Great Lakes Confederation.

 GRL_war_on_corruption:0 "War On Corruption"
 GRL_war_on_corruption_desc:0 "The DeVos administration was filled to the brim with corrupt officials who almost brought the Republican Party down with them. From Rick Snyder, Erik Prince, and DeVos' husband himself, corporate figures have sabotaged the party for their own interests. They must be brought in line as the party is centralized around General Bergman!"
 GRL_encourage_military_politicians:0 "Encourage Military Politicians"
 GRL_encourage_military_politicians_desc:0 "The military itself is the best and most reasonable institution to support and build military policy.

 GRL_return_of_militarist_republicanism:0 "Return Of Militant Republicanism"
 GRL_return_of_militarist_republicanism_desc:0 "Republicans of the past fought bravely against the evils of communism, socialism, and extreme nationalism. It is time we honor their legacy, and bring about a return to the era of militant, patriotic republicanism. The military budget will be expanded, certainly, and the DeVos' government reliance on mercenaries replaced with the strengthening of a true standing army."

 GRL_president_king:0 "The King Presidency"

 GRL_concessions_to_militias:0 "Allies In The Militia Movement"
 GRL_concessions_to_militias_desc:0 "To safeguard our power from the deep state socialists and their cronies, it is clear that we need more allies.

By allying with these militias, we shall have ourselves a powerful ally."

 GRL_god_in_the_great_lakes_desc:0 "We have accomplished what we set out to do. From all over the Great Lakes, our people are rediscovering their faith, their patriotism. While the spectre of Communism is not yet gone from our shores, it is certain that it shall vanish shortly under the combined might of our faith."

 GRL_future_of_politics:0 "The 2013 Election"
 GRL_future_of_politics_desc:0 "Although the Confederal Question has been settled, politics never sleep! With the 2013 election right on schedule, the time has come to define the next four years of politics in the Great Lakes. Let the votes be cast, and the people select those that represent them the best!"

 GRL_moores_gambit:0 "The Vice President Succeeds"
 GRL_moores_gambit_desc:0 "The people have with an overwhelming majority elected Gwen Moore, former Vice President of Melissa Hortman. Given the overwhelming level of support the Democratic Alliance holds among the people, these results were never in doubt. Long live Democracy, long live the Republic."
 GRL_move_towards_socialism:0 "Move Towards Socialism"
 GRL_move_towards_socialism_desc:0 "It is clear that the time has come to finish what President Hortman started, and take our first steps beyond a capitalist society. Democratic Socialism is the future of the Great Lakes, that much is certain, and we shall no longer be held back by greedy businessmen or their stooges in Congress."
 GRL_cement_party_control:0 "Cement Party Control"
 GRL_cement_party_control_desc:0 "The Democratic Alliance is a broad tent, consisting of Socialists, Progressives and Liberals. But perhaps the tent is too broad. We won't be able to carry out our agenda if we constantly bicker among ourselves. Let us remind those against President Moore of their place, reassign them to more suitable positions within the party and replace them with more loyal comrades."
 GRL_anti_religious_agenda:0 "Anti-Religious Platform"
 GRL_anti_religious_agenda_desc:0 "For every step we take, opposition from radical Christian groups only grows larger. Seemingly never happy with the rights we give them, it is clear that they won't be happy until we retreat from all the hard-won rights we've attained over the last century. While state atheism is not the answer, we can certainly work to marginalise these faithful regardless."
 GRL_working_class_coalition:0 "A Working Class Coalition"
 GRL_working_class_coalition_desc:0 "It is not just us who are fighting for the sake of the working class, it is also groups like the Industrial Workers of the World. We would do well to form up with them, to ensure that our coalition shall remain eternally ironclad. Together, we may never be defeated."
 GRL_mass_nationalization:0 "Mass Nationalization"
 GRL_mass_nationalization_desc:0 "To leave our economy in private hands would be to leave it at the mercy of a class that is bound to be hostile towards our agenda. To avert capital flight, we must bring the commanding heights of our economy into public hands immediately, and with as little recompense as possible. That way, we shall finally break the hold the capitalist class holds over this country."
 GRL_war_on_inflation:0 "War On Inflation"
 GRL_war_on_inflation_desc:0 "Rising prices have hollowed out the savings of the working class, while barely affecting the upper classes at all. The time has come to take the fight to this monstrous price gorging, by declaring war on inflation. Our weapons shall be price controls and deflationary policies, and with these, we may make the economy work for the people once more."
 GRL_legalize_marijuana:0 "Legalize Marijuana"
 GRL_legalize_marijuana_desc:0 "It is tough to find legislation as needless as the ban on marijuana. A harmless narcotic is not worth sentencing hundreds, if not thousands, of people to jail yearly over. We will be doing the country a favour by legalising it, allowing our law enforcement to focus on matters much more pressing."
 GRL_new_womans_role:0 "New Woman's Role"
 GRL_new_womans_role_desc:0 "An invaluable, but invisible part of labour has for decades been carried out by women, as homemakers, as cleaners, as mothers. It is high time that we recognise the work women do, and break down the remaining barriers to women's equality in our country."
 GRL_milwaukee_economic_revolution:0 "Milwaukee Economic Revolution"
 GRL_milwaukee_economic_revolution_desc:0 "It is high time to complete our revolution! All remaining private enterprises will either be brought under state control, or forcibly cooperatised! This has seemed inevitable for a while, and the final blow against Capitalism in the Great Lakes will now be struck."

 GRL_progressive_da_rules:0 "Progressive DA In Power"
 GRL_progressive_da_rules_desc:0 "The Democratic Alliance is increasingly growing into a party of the people, as the progressive agenda is becoming part of the party's DNA. With the election of [Root.GetLeader], it is apparent to all that the progressive agenda shows no signs of stopping. To four more years!"
 GRL_establishment_da_rules:0 "Establishment DA In Power"
 GRL_establishment_da_rules_desc:0 "The line set out by Paul Wellstone and Melissa Hortman continues to be upheld by the Democratic Alliance, and that has clearly resounded with the people, as [Root.GetLeader] has been elected on the establishment platform, with the measured reform characterising previous governments showing no signs of stopping."
 GRL_moderate_da_rules:0 "Liberals In Power"
 GRL_moderate_da_rules_desc:0 "Liberalism has returned to the Great Lakes, and is bringing about a new era of reformist, liberal government. This new government is expected to support the welfare state, but without the economic statism that has characterised hitherto leftist governments in the Great Lakes."
 GRL_bolster_the_welfare_state:0 "Bolster The Welfare State"
 GRL_bolster_the_welfare_state_desc:0 "The welfare state is like a life jacket, saving those that need it from sinking beneath the waves. Any insinuation that we should do away with it are thus tantamount to abandoning poor people in need. Instead, we should bolster it, ensuring that our citizens can rest assured that their needs will be sated from cradle to grave."
 GRL_social_unity:0 "Social Unity"
 GRL_social_unity_desc:0 "A society is not just a gathering of individuals, but a great collective of all who live in it. If we feud endlessly over political differences, it is impossible for our society to stand. Let us put political differences aside, and stand together for the values that unite us all."
 GRL_demobilization:0 "Demobilization For Peace"
 GRL_demobilization_desc:0 "War! What is it good for? A cause of war almost as old as human history is mutual distrust caused by mutual rearmament. Although we live in a decade of uncertainty, let us take the first step towards a more peaceful world by demobilising, to show to our neighbours that we wish them no harm. That way, we shall have peace in America forevermore."
 GRL_protect_constitutional_values:0 "Protect Constitutional Values"
 GRL_protect_constitutional_values_desc:0 "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness are unalienable rights from all the way back to 1776, ones that lent themselves to our constitution as well. Today, these are more invaluable than ever, and to not ever stand by them would be dereliction of our duty to the people. Let us reaffirm our commitment to them, so that the torch of liberty shall not be extinguished in the Great Lakes."
 GRL_dawn_of_a_new_republic:0 "A Truly Democratic Republic"
 GRL_dawn_of_a_new_republic_desc:0 "We have come a long way since that fateful day in 1987 when the United States were dissolved. We may not claim succession to the old state, but we can definitely say that more than any other we have come the closest to fulfilling the dream that America was founded upon all those many years ago."

 GRL_moderate_libertarians_rule:0 "Moderate Libertarians In Power"

 GRL_true_libertarians_rule:0 "True Libertarians In Power"
 GRL_true_libertarians_rule_desc:0 "Even when Ventura was turning the party away from its ideals, a few brave souls were able to keep the party true, and now, with this new truly libertarian administration, the Great Lakes will enter into a period of true freedom and prosperity, with freedom from illegitimate obligations to others."
 GRL_continue_regulationism:0 "Continue Regulationism"
 GRL_continue_regulationism_desc:0 "Government regulations, counter to the claims of their detractors, have been a boon to the well-being and the general state of the average Great Lakes citizen. With the Democratic Alliance out of power, many have turned on state intervention in the economy, but regulationism has produced results and is worth keeping around, unlike many of the Alliance’s more socialistic policies."
 GRL_begin_moderate_privatization:0 "Begin Moderate Privatization"
 GRL_begin_moderate_privatization_desc:0 "Members of government agree that it would be foolish to stick with full state control over the economy, but we also can agree it would be devastating to pursue full privatization. We will instead pursue a middle ground, selling off many state enterprises that are non-essential to the functioning of our state. This will ensure a healthy and booming economy in the coming years."
 GRL_begin_largescale_privatization:0 "Begin Large-Scale Privatization"
 GRL_begin_largescale_privatization_desc:0 "State-owned companies are a blight upon freedom, and are yet another disgusting remnant of the anti-business Hortman presidency. As true capitalists, we must begin selling off the vast majority of public enterprise. In private hands, these businesses will be allowed to reach their full potential, free of any state intervention, and bring massive benefits to investors, employees and the public."
 GRL_ban_extremist_groups:0 "Ban Extremist Groups"
 GRL_ban_extremist_groups_desc:0 "To the joy of many, and the dismay of some, our government has decided to crack down on socialist and fascist agitation. This has caused their fellow runners to denounce our government and label us as tyrants; In actuality, our society will greatly benefit from the lack of pamphleteers and protesters blocking the morning commute."
 GRL_open_up_the_spectrum:0 "Open Up The Spectrum"
 GRL_open_up_the_spectrum_desc:0 "As libertarians, we cannot betray our promise to defend the freedom of speech and protect minority beliefs, however unpopular they might be amongst the majority. Our nation will benefit from the political diversity of the nation, and in time when they realize nobody is listening to their outlandish rants, extremists on the right and left will finally lay down their banners and come to the right side."
 GRL_fight_bloated_bureaucracy:0 "Fight Bloated Bureaucracy"
 GRL_fight_bloated_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Bureaucracy is the legacy of the Democratic Alliance most Lakers rather dislike, and so we will focus on dislodging it from government, making day to day proceedings of government much more efficient in the process."
 GRL_embrace_social_progressivism:0 "Embrace Progressive Humanism"
 GRL_embrace_social_progressivism_desc:0 "We believe in the full potential of human beings to reform, to change and to rebuild their world for the betterment of themselves and the generations who will inherit their world. We will do all we can to promote this by expanding human freedom and to limit the debilitating role of government in daily human life."
 GRL_finalize_police_reform:0 "Moderate Police Reform"
 GRL_finalize_police_reform_desc:0 "The police has not seen reform since the days of the collapse. While the socialists and the fascists pander to extreme fantasies that are two sides of the same coin, we will reform the police so that they can enforce the law without impeding the liberty of the people, and ensure that they can be held accountable by the very same people, and not just a potentially corrupt government."
 GRL_dawn_of_a_new_confederation:0 "Dawn Of A New Confederation"
 GRL_dawn_of_a_new_confederation_desc:0 "The days of Hortman’s ‘democratic socialism’ are over, as are the days of the old political labels of the Midwest. A new Confederation has come into being, with the preservation of liberty and the pursuit of prosperity being the very lifeblood of this new nation."

 GRL_moderate_conservatives_rule:0 "Moderate Conservatives In Power"
 GRL_moderate_conservatives_rule_desc:0 "Conservative principles in the Great Lakes have been suppressed ever since the tragic days of the Collapse. With this victory, the principles that propped up American greatness right up until the country’s subversion by Communism will make their return, and the people will once again experience a moral, prosperous life based on these values."
 GRL_hardline_republicans_rule:0 "Hardline Conservatives In Power"
 GRL_hardline_republicans_rule_desc:0 "Finally, we have triumphed. While communists and traitors protest, they will not be able to stop us from restoring true moral values to this nation. We shall fight Communism in all forms and restore a proper society to the Great Lakes."
 GRL_whittle_away_at_healthcare:0 "Support Healthcare Privatization"
 GRL_whittle_away_at_healthcare_desc:0 "So called ‘public’ healthcare is just another front for socialism, and so we must do everything we can to end its hypnotic regime over the Great Lakes. Once again, our allies in the private sector will be more than eager to help us out with our agenda. Perhaps a little too eager..."
 GRL_crush_state_monopolies:0 "Crush Government Monopolies"
 GRL_crush_state_monopolies_desc:0 "The government under Hortman seized many companies as a part of their nationalization efforts, and it falls to us to remedy this. The government’s monopoly on sectors from public transportation to manufacturing will be dissolved, and they will return to their proper places in private ownership."
 GRL_disavow_the_radicals:0 "Disavow The Radicals"
 GRL_disavow_the_radicals_desc:0 "The radical militias, however many good intentions they may have, paint conservatism in a terrible lighting for many ordinary Lakers. We will denounce their leaders and principles, while doing nothing to actually persecute them. If we ignore them, the people of the Great Lakes will hopefully ignore them as well."
 GRL_strengthen_intelligence_committees:0 "Strengthen National Intelligence"
 GRL_strengthen_intelligence_committees_desc:0 "Intelligence agencies have a poor reputation among the people of the Great Lakes. Unfortunately for them, this sector of national security will have to be properly funded and supported if we are to suppress socialist subversion at home."
 GRL_support_our_troops:0 "Jingoistic Fervor"
 GRL_support_our_troops_desc:0 "As our nation strengthens itself, we look out at a continent shattered, the work of traitors whose goals came to fruition decades ago. We must take vengeance for all the terror the Communists and all the other traitors have wreaked across this once-united country, and we must begin preparations for war with our neighbors immediately."
 GRL_war_on_communism:0 "Bulwark Against Socialism"
 GRL_war_on_communism_desc:0 "On a continent of leftist tyranny, from the corrupt trade unionists of Philadelphia to the lapdogs of Soviet hegemony in Los Angeles, the Great Lakes will stand proudly as a bulwark against this red menace. We must take every step to weed out and purge every servant of socialism both at home and amidst the former Americans we are preparing to liberate."
 GRL_bastion_of_freedom:0 "Bastion Of Freedom"
 GRL_bastion_of_freedom_desc:0 "The Great Lakes will endure as a bastion of freedom, harkening back to the golden age of American freedom and prosperity. We have learned from the past, and we will not make the same mistakes. The oppressed peoples of this former nation will soon know that somewhere out there is a country fighting for their very freedom."

 GRL_perfect_democracy:0 "Nationalist Principles Survive"
 GRL_perfect_democracy_desc:0 "The nationalist principles of Steve King and his Christian People’s Party, enduring relentless assault from enemies and traitors all over the spectrum, have been soundly upheld by the people of the Great Lakes. Now, it is time to continue the crusade to rebuild the Great Lakes on Christian principles, and to begin a new one choking out socialist traitors once and for all."
 GRL_rally_for_social_conservatism:0 "Rally For Social Conservatism"
 GRL_rally_for_social_conservatism_desc:0 "The values of Christ are the values of King and his government, and we will make it known that these are the only values that will be tolerated within these lands. The degeneracy that has engulfed the now-shattered American psyche since the 60s will no longer be tolerated!"
 GRL_unite_christians:0 "Unite Christians"
 GRL_unite_christians_desc:0 "Mr. King, a converted Roman Catholic, showed his fellow Christian Americans that they can work together to change their country for the better. Not since the election of Ronald Reagan in the waning years of the United States were Christians able to rally in defence of the values that make this country great."
 GRL_evangelical_supremacy:0 "Evangelical Supremacy"
 GRL_evangelical_supremacy_desc:0 "Our crusade requires leadership that knows how to play the political game. Despite the ecumenical roots of the CPP, it is clear that Evangelicals, historically the most politically aware and engaged American Christians, must take a leading position in both our party and our nation."
 GRL_war_on_activism:0 "War On Activists"
 GRL_war_on_activism_desc:0 "The activists are the footsoldiers of the godless Communists, poisoning the minds of the people of the Great Lakes. Having emerged during the Hortman era, our rise to power has accelerated their violent action against the state. Their call to revolution, if not contained, will totally and irreversibly tear down whatever we are trying to build. We will crush them using whatever methods we feel are necessary."
 GRL_reverse_socialist_humiliation:0 "Reverse Socialist Humiliation"
 GRL_reverse_socialist_humiliation_desc:0 "The socialists have already taken countless nations, shattered and broken them, and enslaved their peoples for a truly malicious ideology. We must do whatever we can to protect our people, our land, and our faith from falling to the same fate, and to do this we must expand the power of our state."
 GRL_disenfranchise_urban_voters:0 "Disenfranchise Urban Voters"
 GRL_disenfranchise_urban_voters_desc:0 "The urbanites of the Great Lakes, as the backbone of liberal and left wing parties, are a threat to King’s continued rule. Their support for the socialist Hortman should not go unpunished, and more importantly their powerful political power as a significant section of the electorate must be erased."
 GRL_close_our_borders:0 "Close Our Borders"
 GRL_close_our_borders_desc:0 "We are surrounded everywhere by those who seek to destroy us. Whether they come in the form of soldiers or so called ‘refugees,’ we will shut them out. Our Christian republic is a Paradise amongst hells, and it shall not be intruded upon."

 GLR_clarkes_junta:0 "The Sheriff's Country"
 GLR_clarkes_junta_desc:0 "Melissa Hortman was on the path to turn the Great Lakes from a beacon of free-market economics and personal responsibility into a subordinate of Chomsky's authoritarian machinations. Thankfully, David Clarke and the loyal patriots behind him have marched right into Milwaukee, and the tide has finally turned against socialist traitors."
 GLR_crush_the_militias:0 "Crush The Militia Movement"
 GLR_crush_the_militias_desc:0 "The militia movement fights for benefactors beyond their understanding and the whims of a libertarian ideal that only serves to strengthen those who ferment dissent. We shall give them a firm boot, and let them know that they are not welcome in a Clarke administration, nor on our streets."
 GLR_align_moderate_militias:0 "Toe The Line"
 GLR_align_moderate_militias_desc:0 "A case-by-case approach in dealing with militias will both ensure loyalty to the Clarke regime among our perceived allies and give us the leave to crush those who we see as damaging to the restoration of civil obedience. Patriots all shall join us in the fight against socialism!"
 GLR_right_wing_unity:0 "Unite Against The Menace"
 GLR_right_wing_unity_desc:0 "It is clear that we will inevitably reject the despicable ideologies of far-right militias when Clarke further consolidates control, but in the meantime, there is no reason not to ally with like-minded patriots in this time of national crisis.\n\nBetter dead than red."
 GLR_suspend_habeas_corpus:0 "Suspend Habeas Corpus"
 GLR_suspend_habeas_corpus_desc:0 "As the constitution of the United States so eloquently declares, the right to habeas corpus can be waived during rebellion or invasion. As rebels are already on the streets to reverse Clarke's restoration of order, encouraged by the DA, it is clear that the Hortman administration and their allies no longer have the right to their civil and judicial solutions."
 GLR_crush_activist_traitors:0 "Crush Activist Traitors"
 GLR_crush_activist_traitors_desc:0 "To a revolutionary activist, there is nothing more appealing than the right to riot freely - to destroy property and livelihood with the petty justification of "revolution". Anarchists and looters fill our streets, and it is time to flush them out with the full might of the sheriffs and police force."
 GLR_reinstate_new_congressmen:0 "A Reactionary Congress"
 GLR_reinstate_new_congressmen_desc:0 "President David Clarke’s Congress will not be filled with spineless libertarians or weak-willed conservatives. Instead, the majority will be made up of members of the Christian People’s Party, who are devoted to principles aligned with the President’s."
 GLR_the_grand_conspiracy:0 "The Grand Conspiracy"
 GLR_the_grand_conspiracy_desc:0 "The socialists of Hortman are not the moderates they claim to be. They are radicals, pure and simple, and much more closer to the tyrants in Philadelphia and Los Angeles than they have led the people to believe. We will remove them, one by one, until their influence on every level of government has totally vanished."
 GLR_superian_standing_army:0 "A Loyal Standing Army"
 GLR_superian_standing_army_desc:0 "The armed forces must be loyal to our cause. We know there are loyalists to the old government, and we will weed them out just as we had with the traitors in the government. We shall have a proud army again."

 GLR_integrate_radical_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Paramilitaries and their leaders, from Vanderboegh to the Hutaree, command a significant portion of the right in the Great Lakes.

 GLR_restore_the_republic:0 "Restore The Constitution"
 GLR_restore_the_republic_desc:0 "The Constitution has become meaningless in America ever since the Collapse. President Clarke intends on reversing this trend, and will ensure that the law that the Founding Fathers created for the people becomes the backbone of the Great Lakes and beyond."
 GLR_business_council:0 "Create A Business Advisory Council"
 GLR_business_council_desc:0 "The corporations of the Great Lakes have been marginalized too long by Communists. If we are to regain their trust, we should create an official partnership between the government and the biggest corporations, a body where they can voice their frustrations, give us advice, and maybe even hold some real authority over sectors they would be better off managing."
 GLR_permit_proselytism:0 "Permit Proselytism"
 GLR_permit_proselytism_desc:0 "It is a simple, yet tragic fact that many in the Great Lakes have forgotten the faith of Christianity. In order to reverse this decline, we must grant Christians the freedom to spread their faith to those who are weak in the faith, and those who have fallen completely for the poison of atheism. Some may denounce this as an assault on the separation between church and state, but yet again, they forget how America was founded as a Christian nation."
 GLR_roll_back_social_reforms:0 "Roll Back Social Reforms"
 GLR_roll_back_social_reforms_desc:0 "From abortion to homosexual rights, from ungodly scientific research to the decriminilzation of many drugs, our predecessors have spat on good morals and have allowed degenerate practices to run wild. We will not abide by this."
 GLR_hike_police_spending:0 "Hike Police Spending"
 GLR_hike_police_spending_desc:0 "The police are the enforcers of the Republic, it’s laws, and it’s Constitution. To keep our Republic free from crime and other maladies, we must give extra funding to departments all over the Great Lakes, as well as invest more in national police forces."
 GLR_win_corporations_back:0 "Win Corporations Back"
 GLR_win_corporations_back_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the extent of socialist economic decay is deeper than previously thought, and corporations, a key leg of our support base, are still on the fence about embracing a relationship with the government. This is understandable, as our government still hasn’t broken sufficiently with the old. We must do whatever we can to win the titans of industry back."
 GLR_buy_superian_campaign:0 ""Buy Laker" Campaign"
 GLR_buy_superian_campaign_desc:0 "We have been reliant on foreign goods for too long, and our people need to detach themselves from socialist imports.

 GLR_crush_minnesota_economic_elite:0 "Crush The Minnesota Economic Elite"
 GLR_crush_minnesota_economic_elite_desc:0 "The socialists of Minneapolis have been a key reason behind the decline of the economy, from the greedy politicians to the power-corrupted state managers, to personal enemies of President Clarke himself. Now, we will strike at them, weakening their base of power until they totally collapse, bringing with them their sickly doctrines of state oppression of private business and the individual."
 GLR_mass_privatization:0 "Mass Privatization"
 GLR_mass_privatization_desc:0 "To fully rip out socialism’s influences, we will begin destroying the deepest and darkest legacy of their government, the nationalized companies. When they have been returned to private ownership, only then can our Republic’s chained economy truly flourish."
 GLR_authoritarian_constitutionalism:0 "Authoritarian Constitutionalism"
 GLR_authoritarian_constitutionalism_desc:0 "President Clarke is not a tyrant, but he has taken up some rather harsh tactics in order to govern the Great Lakes. Unfortunately, the enemies of the Great Lakes make this necessary, and they are still out there. The Lakers will prosper economically, rediscover and strengthen their Christian faith, and remold themselves into patriots their ancestors could smile upon."

 SGL_sic_semper_tyrannis:0 "Thus Always To Tyrants"
 SGL_sic_semper_tyrannis_desc:0 "History has a tradition of bringing justice where there is injustice, to bring down tyrants who think they can rule over the workers.

So, as the old Romans said, Sic Semper Tyrannis!"
 SGL_form_revolutionary_tribunals:0 "Form Revolutionary Tribunals"

 SGL_free_the_natives:0 "Free The Natives"
 SGL_free_the_natives_desc:0 "For too long have the Native-American populace, that originally lived in these lands, been oppressed and deprived of economic and social development.

 SGL_integrate_the_radicals:0 "Integrate The Radicals"
 SGL_integrate_the_radicals_desc:0 "The previously ruling Democratic Alliance was a party of mostly liberal, mixed-economy-minded capitalists who don’t deserve a say in our government.

It’s necessary we decide a course of action on this."
 SGL_crush_the_police:0 "Crush The Police"
 SGL_crush_the_police_desc:0 "The police is a tool of reactionary tyranny. That fact has been known for ages. However, no actions have been taken to stop them. No more!

 SGL_war_on_fascism_desc:0 "A war on fascism is not only necessary but righteous! With our government police and loyal followers, like the Soviets of yore, we will expel the fascist bastards, reactionary racists through what can only be compared to a holy war. They will not pass!"

 SGL_pan_socialist_popular_front_desc:0 "A popular front needs to be established if we don’t want our government to be infiltrated and brought down by bourgeois reactionaries. All leftists must heed to the call of unity and cooperation, as we rebuild from the ashes."
 SGL_fate_of_western_loyalists:0 "The Western Loyalists"
 SGL_fate_of_western_loyalists_desc:0 "One of the more contested decisions to take will be how our government treats those loyal to the communist Pacific government. Some say it’s best to shun them, as they support a ‘fascistic, totalitarian Soviet puppet’, but others say they’re important allies in the struggle against capitalism. It is up to us to decide now."

 SGL_attack_coddled_progressives_desc:0 "The American People's Commonwealth was built as a shining example of socialism for the people, but it has only left broken hearts and dreams in its wake.

 SGL_attack_soulless_stalinists_desc:0 "The Union of American People's Republics has betrayed its revolutionary activist founding to return to the very trappings of the Soviet Union and the dying Warsaw Pact.

 SGL_true_revolutionary_ideology:0 "Theory Into Practice"
 SGL_true_revolutionary_ideology_desc:0 "Now that the working class and its allies have taken the reins of power, we must translate socialist theory into socialist practice.

 SGL_peoples_police_forces_desc:0 "The police force, once another arm of the oppressive capitalist regime, will be reformed so that it truly serves the masses. Through a series of extensive reforms, especially the promotion of community policing, the police will once again walk the streets, but this time in service of the people, and not in oppression of them in service of a higher class."
 SGL_end_urban_abandonment:0 "End Urban Abandonment"
 SGL_end_urban_abandonment_desc:0 "The cities of the Great Lakes, from Milwaukee to Minneapolis, have slowly seen their streets and neighborhoods fall into a tragic decline and an eerie silence. We will reverse this trend, and one day, they will be not just rebuilt and reinhabited, but the pride of our Union."
 SGL_organize_the_workers:0 "Organize The Working Class"
 SGL_organize_the_workers_desc:0 "The working class are our primary support base, but unfortunately many of them have done nothing to aid in the construction of socialism. We must properly mobilize for their true role in the Union as participants in the workers government! We will do this primarily through the creation and expansion of mass organizations, and soon every section of society will come under our purview."
 SGL_collective_burden:0 "A Collective Burden"
 SGL_collective_burden_desc:0 "Individualist ideology still poisons the Great Lakes. We must remind the masses that the revolution has transformed everything for the better, and that their mindsets of being soulless cogs in the capitalist machine must be replaced. We share a collective burden in upholding the revolution!"
 SGL_revolutionary_councils:0 "Revolutionary Worker's Councils"
 SGL_revolutionary_councils_desc:0 "Like the Soviets of old, the workers councils will be the primary method by which our Union is governed. They will be simply the organ through which the people express their will. This will be a government whose sole authority is the masses and their allies, and them alone."
 SGL_defend_our_cities:0 "Defend Our Cities"
 SGL_defend_our_cities_desc:0 "Our cities, centers of the revolution and centers of our nascent government, are under attack from far-right infiltration. The militia groups of the Republic still exist, and are surely behind these attempts to tear down our cities. We must crack them before they can do anything serious to our cities and our people."
 SGL_heal_agricultural_lethargy:0 "Heal Agricultural Lethargy"
 SGL_heal_agricultural_lethargy_desc:0 "The fields of the Great Lakes have been too long dominated by large agricultural corporations who somehow survived the collapse. This, in turn, has perpetuated a lull in activity, where crops, livestock and other agricultural goods are raised not for the benefit of the people, but for the profit of the corporations. Collectivization will ensure that the agricultural sector of the Union is resurrected."
 SGL_socialist_unity_government:0 "Socialist Unity Government"
 SGL_socialist_unity_government_desc:0 "We must squash sectarianism by forming a government that unites every socialist in the Great Lakes. More and more will realize that, while they may not necessarily agree with some of our methods, they will agree with our eventual aims."
 SGL_a_peoples_commonwealth:0 "For A People's Commonwealth"
 SGL_a_peoples_commonwealth_desc:0 "The American People’s Commonwealth has strayed from the path of socialism. We will not accept their corruption, their distortion, and their lies any longer. We must liberate the People’s Commonwealth and reforge into a true bastion of socialism!"

 SGL_emergency_party_conference:0 "Emergency Party Conference"
 SGL_emergency_party_conference_desc:0 "Certain issues have reared their heads, certain issues that we can no longer ignore. In order to ensure the future of socialism in the Great Lakes and beyond, we will hold an emergency party conference to determine the true leaders of our revolution."
 SGL_old_guard_primacy:0 "Old Guard Primacy"
 SGL_old_guard_primacy_desc:0 "The old guard of the People’s Commonwealth have taken power. Believing in a gradual, popular approach to socialism, one that’s free of the coercion and authoritarianism replicated by the Soviet Union and it’s innumerable puppets across the world. Of course, they still have the dream of socialism as their guiding vision, but they will fulfill it through the doctrine of Bookchinism, not Marxism-Leninism."
 SGL_peaceful_socialist_experiment:0 "Peaceful Socialist Experiment"
 SGL_peaceful_socialist_experiment_desc:0 "The old guard rejects the violence and the oppression of the extremists. We believe in a peaceful path to socialism, one that will have the approval of the majority of the people. And if we face opposition from well-intending opponents, we will not stamp them out, but face them with discourse and discussion. The same thing, however, cannot be promised to the fascists..."
 SGL_replace_walker_cult:0 "Fight The Walker Cult"
 SGL_replace_walker_cult_desc:0 "Angela Walker has been causing trouble in the IWW for some time now. Her authoritarian tendencies have shown her as a danger to our goals, and her influence, which still lingers among younger comrades, must be curbed."
 SGL_embrace_communalism:0 "Embrace Communalism"
 SGL_embrace_communalism_desc:0 "Communalism will be the path by which our society will be totally transformed. Every community will be given autonomy, and be free to make the choices that impact themselves the most, while federating with other communities to make the decisions that impact our country. Communalism will chip away at the hierarchical tradition of capitalism, and bring about a truly equal society."
 SGL_social_ecology:0 "Social Ecology"
 SGL_social_ecology_desc:0 "The link between social issues and the decline of the environment has been analyzed in the past, but now for the first time, these two broad problems will be finally solved in accordance with each other. The first step we will take in the implementation of social ecology is the ensurance of the commons such as water, air, and a habitable earth. Only then can we proceed with everything else."
 SGL_true_revolutionary_primacy:0 "True Revolutionary Primacy"
 SGL_true_revolutionary_primacy_desc:0 "Howie Hawkins and his Old Guard, who have led the IWW for decades, have lost the struggle for power. Now, with Angela Walker and the true revolutionaries at the helm, true socialism will be built, and every one last of it’s enemies will be crushed with a ruthless ferocity."
 SGL_erase_the_committee:0 "Erase The Committee"
 SGL_erase_the_committee_desc:0 "The Committee is the pinnacle symbol of corruption for the citizens of the People’s Commonwealth; no wonder, with their delirious thirst for power at the expense of the building of true socialism! We will arrest and imprison every Committee member, and do our best to cleanse the legacy left by this disgusting institution."
 SGL_reconstruction:0 "Sweeping Reconstruction"
 SGL_reconstruction_desc:0 "The North East has suffered terrible damage during our liberation, but even that pales in comparison to the damages wrought by the Central Committee’s misrule of the country. We shall enact a sweeping reconstruction, to ensure that these damages are mended."
 SGL_integrate_the_north_east:0 "Integrate The North-East"
 SGL_integrate_the_north_east_desc:0 "The task ahead is monumental. The Trade Councils were corrupt, and the less that is said about the Central Committee, the better. A brand new governing structure has to be put in place from the ground up, and be made protected against those that would do it harm. We are ready for that task."
 SGL_continue_the_urban_focus:0 "Continue The Urban Focus"
 SGL_continue_the_urban_focus_desc:0 "It is in the cities where the vast majority of people live, and so it is in the cities where the brunt of our attention will be focused. There is always more to do, more to fix. The countryside can take care of its own issues, it always has."
 SGL_restore_class_consciousness:0 "Restore Class Consciousness"
 SGL_restore_class_consciousness_desc:0 "Decades of Central Committee subversion have caused the people of the North East to forget their class consciousness, falsely believing themselves liberated, and ignoring the new red bourgeoisie. By reminding them of their proletarian origins, they shall never again let tyrants subvert the revolution!"
 SGL_legacy_of_the_emancipators:0 "Legacy Of The Emancipators"
 SGL_legacy_of_the_emancipators_desc:0 "We are but the heirs of a movement stretching back a century. The Black Panthers, the Wobblies and many, many others started the fight that we have finished. It is in their shadow that we walk, and we have a proud legacy to uphold yet."
 SGL_anti_terrorist_crusade:0 "Anti-Terrorist Crusade"
 SGL_anti_terrorist_crusade_desc:0 "It is time for us to be honest about the ‘patriotic and constitutionalist’ militias that plague the formed United States what they are. They are terrorists. Terrorists who worship the archaic constitution of the bourgeoisie government of a fallen nation. Terrorists who, for the good of the working people, must be liquidated just as the Laker terrorists were."

 SGL_lindsays_faction:0 "Lindsay's Utopians"
 SGL_lindsays_faction_desc:0 "The GLPC opted for unity! Electing Peta Lindsay as president of the new, socialist Great Lakes, it is clear that the future of the country lies with a broad coalition of the left, rather than division and conflict."
 SGL_in_footsteps_of_progressives:0 "In Footsteps Of Progressives"
 SGL_in_footsteps_of_progressives_desc:0 "Our cause did not come out of nothing. Many bold comrades, even people not socialists, have come before us, paving the way for us to continue their work and finish what they started. Their work must be remembered."
 SGL_popular_sovereignty:0 "Popular Sovereignty"
 SGL_popular_sovereignty_desc:0 "Socialism is the truest form of democracy, and was our revolution not to bring down the oppressive regime of Steve King? The fulfillment of our promises lies in popular sovereignty, actual democracy, the empowerment of the working class to make their own decisions, so let us bring that about."
 SGL_codify_racial_justice:0 "Codify Racial Justice"
 SGL_codify_racial_justice_desc:0 "Nice words and bold statements are not enough to wipe away the stain of racism from our lands. We must change our legislation, our societal structures, from the ground up, in order to bring about true justice in our society."
 SGL_recover_from_urban_decline:0 "Recover From Urban Decline"
 SGL_recover_from_urban_decline_desc:0 "Despite hitherto governments’ pretensions of caring for the government, it is clear that they have let our great industrial cities decline, caring more about the profits of a small elite than the people. We must reverse that, and reforge our cities as beacons of the revolution."
 SGL_in_footsteps_of_revolutionaries:0 "In Footsteps Of Revolutionaries"
 SGL_in_footsteps_of_revolutionaries_desc:0 "The path we are walking was laid out by brave people, ready and willing to risk their lives for a better future. What we are accomplishing could not have been done without the work of those that came before."
 SGL_banner_of_the_youth:0 "Banner Of The Youth"
 SGL_banner_of_the_youth_desc:0 "Some of our boldest allies in the struggle for emancipation have been the younger generations, whose cries have fallen on deaf ears for too long. With one of their own in power, however, their chance to be heard has at long last come."
 SGL_fight_bureaucratic_collectivism:0 "Fight Bureaucratic Collectivism"
 SGL_fight_bureaucratic_collectivism_desc:0 "So many revolutions have all fallen into the trap of bureaucratic collectivism. The people are not emancipated, just because management of their workplaces is taken over by state bureaucrats. Instead, true economic power must lie in their hands, with every enterprise being owned by the working class!"
 SGL_a_great_lakes_commonwealth:0 "A Great Lakes Commonwealth"
 SGL_a_great_lakes_commonwealth_desc:0 "The most terrible poison of all is that of division, the belief that we must fight our allies instead of standing together, simply because of minute differences. We must band together, in commonwealth, if the revolution is to succeed."
 SGL_a_more_idealist_union:0 "A More Idealist Union"
 SGL_a_more_idealist_union_desc:0 "’Pragmatism’ is merely the corrupt way of saying 'selling out’. We have been careful thus far to not abandon the principles of our revolution, but more care must yet be had. Only with a double-commitment to our ideals, and to expel those that do not heed them, can we safekeep the revolution forevermore."
 SGL_anarchist_self_management:0 "Anarchist Self-Management"
 SGL_anarchist_self_management_desc:0 "It is preposterous to believe that all we need for equality is a sufficient number of bureaucrats in Milwaukee. No, instead we shall look to granting self-management to each and every economic enterprise in the country, to truly emancipate the producers of our country."
 SGL_radical_pacifism:0 "Radical Pacifism"
 SGL_radical_pacifism_desc:0 "The only ones to benefit from rampant militarism is the bourgeoisie, whose greed can never be contained within just one country alone. Although some measure of defense is important, we must forevermore swear off foreign military adventures."
 SGL_endorse_central_planning:0 "Return of Central Planning"
 SGL_endorse_central_planning_desc:0 "We cannot cede a single inch to Capitalism, not even if it disguises itself as Socialism. Only through centrally planning our economy may we safekeep it against Capitalist undermining. We will, however, make sure to make it more accountable than the authoritarian Soviet model."
 SGL_revolutionary_socialist_solidarity:0 "Revolutionary Socialist Solidarity"
 SGL_revolutionary_socialist_solidarity_desc:0 "The American People’s Commonwealth is, for all of its shortcomings, a valuable ally in the struggle for emancipation. Aligning our policy with that of [NEA.Root.Capital.GetName] would only serve to further tie us together. For a free and equal America!"
 SGL_ideological_purity:0 "Embrace Ideological Purity"
 SGL_ideological_purity_desc:0 "We cannot trust the revisionists in Philadelphia. Only our revolution has managed to stay the course, to not fall astray into revisionism and dictatorship. Instead of tying ourselves with such fallen regimes, let us instead make sure that we are building the best country that we can."
 SGL_build_left_unity:0 "Build Leftist Unity"
 SGL_build_left_unity_desc:0 "Sectarianism has been a curse on leftism ever since its beginning with more time being wasted on infighting than making progress. With this in mind, we shall unify the leftist movements of our Republic and seek compromise with those who might split from us. Left unity will be essential for a prosperous government."
 SGL_commit_to_social_justice:0 "Commit to Social Justice"
 SGL_commit_to_social_justice_desc:0 "The scourge of injustice must never again rear its head in the Great Lakes! Only if our government commits itself fully to the establishment of social justice in our country may the promises of revolution be fulfilled, and so we shall not waiver."
 SGL_drug_legalization:0 "Support Drug Legalization"
 SGL_drug_legalization_desc:0 "Previous states have whipped themselves into a frenzy trying to prosecute people for the ‘crime’ of possessing narcotics, a harmless action if there ever was one. We should legalise drugs, so that we can save our resources for more pertinent matters."
 SGL_overhauled_healthcare_system:0 "Overhauled Healthcare System"
 SGL_overhauled_healthcare_system_desc:0 "Never before has anyone in the Great Lakes been as bold and ambitious with healthcare reform like us. We shall finally sweep away the vestiges of private healthcare, making sure that every single of the people’s healthcare needs will be taken care of. With that, we may finally cure the illness of Capitalism."

 SGL_la_dukes_faction:0 "LaDuke's Green Socialists"

 SGL_ecosocialist_vision:0 "Ecosocialist Vision"
 SGL_ecosocialist_vision_desc:0 "Capitalism has failed completely at safekeeping the environment. As we are reforging society, let us not just limit our vision to society, but extend it to the place we live as well. Socialism without ecology is only half the picture."
 SGL_green_new_deal:0 "A Green New Deal"
 SGL_green_new_deal_desc:0 "The green transition cannot just happen by tuning small aspects of society, it must be a total reconstruction of our energy grids and transportation sectors. A project of this scale can only be completed with a new deal, a green new deal!"
 SGL_legalize_opposition_parties:0 "Legalize Opposition Parties"
 SGL_legalize_opposition_parties_desc:0 "We cannot replace King’s dictatorship with a red dictatorship. Socialism must bring democracy about with it, to make sure that emancipation is total, and does not just replace one tyrant with another. Even if they may not believe in Socialism yet, the opposition will be restored, democracy hinges on it."
 SGL_fight_iww_primacy:0 "Fight IWW Primacy"
 SGL_fight_iww_primacy_desc:0 "We must not make the same mistakes as the People’s Commonwealth, the Industrial Workers of the World cannot become the sole party of government. To ensure that pluralism may continue to flourish within our Socialist Union, we should support other parties and prevent one from asserting dominance over the others."
 SGL_cement_the_party:0 "Cement the Party"
 SGL_cement_the_party_desc:0 "The Greens have come to stay. No more shall we just be some minor party for the others to coalition with, no, we must grow and assert our influence in its own right, with a unified platform in a unified Congress. The country will be better off for it."
 SGL_make_good_on_the_treaties:0 "Make Good on the Treaties"
 SGL_make_good_on_the_treaties_desc:0 "The treatment suffered by native americans within our country is deplorable and can only at best be called willfully neglectful. We must right this wrong, so long overdue, and return to the native americans the territories that they have been legally entitled to for all this time."
 SGL_repair_the_reservations:0 "Repair the Reservations"
 SGL_repair_the_reservations_desc:0 "The neglect the reservations have suffered have relegated them to being little better than ghettos, where poverty reigns and opportunities are in short supply. We should invest massively in the reservation, to lift up those that previous governments have left behind."
 SGL_fresh_local_elections:0 "Fresh Local Elections"
 SGL_fresh_local_elections_desc:0 "The Great Lakes People’s Congress still has numerous vacancies, as former representatives still refuse to take up their seats again. For proper government, those must be filled, and what better way to do that than a showcase that democracy still reigns in the Great Lakes?"
 SGL_coalition_with_communalists:0 "Coalition with Communalists"
 SGL_coalition_with_communalists_desc:0 "The Socialist Bloc has asserted itself, and for a green future, we must align ourselves with it. Thankfully, the Communalists broadly agree with our ecological agenda, and although they are bolder than us on the economic agenda, we are sure to be able to work out a healthy partnership with them."
 SGL_coalition_with_democratic_alliance:0 "Coalition with the DA"
 SGL_coalition_with_democratic_alliance_desc:0 "The Great Lakes have not yet cast away the old parties entirely. The Democratic Coalition won an upset, and although they may wish for a greater degree of private ownership, they are willing to work with us on that. Some may argue that this is a step back for socialism, but it is a great victory for democracy."
 SGL_embrace_democratic_self_management:0 "Embrace Democratic Self-Management"
 SGL_embrace_democratic_self_management_desc:0 "Who knows more about what is going on at a business than the workers themselves? To rob from them their right to run their workplaces makes us no better than the capitalists. Democratic Self-Management is the best way for us to ensure that workers’ power shall reign forever more."
 SGL_embrace_human_rights:0 "Enshrine Civil Rights"
 SGL_embrace_human_rights_desc:0 "Human dignity is inviolable. Nobody has the right to restrict anyone else from speaking, doing or living as they want, not even the state.

 SGL_tolerate_limited_privatization:0 "Ease Private Ownership Restrictions"
 SGL_tolerate_limited_privatization_desc:0 "Equality can be established without quashing free initiative. While we should still be careful to not allow the establishment of a new corporate elite, tolerating small businesses surely doesn’t hurt anyone."

 SGL_return_of_the_emigres_desc:0 "It is not too late. If the Americans in Canada act decisively now they can rescue us from the brink of socialist tyranny.

 SGL_vice_president_carson:0 "Vice President Carson"
 SGL_vice_president_carson_desc:0 "The reconstruction of liberty in the Great Lakes requires a loyal right hand. Ben Carson has long been a stalwart on the Republican right, and would certainly be very agreeable to President Prince. He shall be appointed Vice President."
 SGL_cement_the_mercenary_republic:0 "Cement the Mercenary Republic"
 SGL_cement_the_mercenary_republic_desc:0 "When the standard armed forces failed, there were thankfully the private military contractors.

 SGL_enshrine_christian_ethics:0 "Enshrine Christian Ethics"
 SGL_enshrine_christian_ethics_desc:0 "The moral decay that successive secular governments permitted practically opened the door for the Socialists to take over. Steve King may have attempted to solve the issue, but failed, so it now falls to us to safeguard the moral fiber of our nation."
 SGL_guns_for_all:0 "Guns for All"
 SGL_guns_for_all_desc:0 "The socialists were only able to take over because faithful patriots were not armed. On Vice President Carson’s suggestion, we will now begin issuing armaments to every patriot, so that the cold hand of tyranny may never again grip our fair lands."
 SGL_prosperity_gospel:0 "Promote the Prosperity Gospel"
 SGL_prosperity_gospel_desc:0 "The Lord rewards faith with tangible benefits. The detriments our country has suffered in the last few years are a result of a faithless government, just as the poor are merely those among us who do not believe enough. Let us spread the good news to the people, so that we may all prosper!"
 SGL_vice_president_lugar:0 "Vice President Lugar"
 SGL_vice_president_lugar_desc:0 "Erik Prince cannot govern alone, he needs support from the other Commonwealth exiles. A leading figure there is the old senator Dick Lugar, who is regarded as the grandfather of the exiles. He will bolster our support, and surely such an old man will not be an actual threat."
 SGL_pass_the_snyder_cuts:0 "Pass the Snyder Cuts"
 SGL_pass_the_snyder_cuts_desc:0 "Successive governments have only increased the burden of taxation upon the people further and further. How can we be a free country when so much is taken from our citizens? Widespread tax cuts must be enacted, for freedom to ring in our country."
 SGL_radical_decommunization:0 "Radical Decommunisation"
 SGL_radical_decommunization_desc:0 "The pernicious influence of Communists in our country has clearly been allowed to fester for too long.

 SGL_sabotage_princes_agenda_desc:0 "Erik Prince may have swept away the Socialist tyranny in our land, but he easily seems like a tyrant in the making himself. Vice President Lugar will use the powers of his office to restrict his seizure of power, so that democracy may not perish in our lands."
 SGL_restore_congress:0 "Restore Congress"
 SGL_restore_congress_desc:0 "Congress was scattered during the socialist coup, but we cannot be without this all-essential government organ. The checks and balances must be restored, and so we shall reorganise Congress. It will only be interim, as more proper elections will be held eventually."
 SGL_end_the_militia_partnership:0 "End the Militia Partnership"
 SGL_end_the_militia_partnership_desc:0 "The militias may have been fierce supporters of Erik Prince, but the time has come to put an end.

 SGL_merge_standing_army_and_militias:0 "Merge Standing Army and Militias"
 SGL_merge_standing_army_and_militias_desc:0 "Loyalty should not go unrewarded. The militias were courageous allies against the socialist tyranny, but the current state of affairs is untenable. We should integrate them into our armed forces, and obviously give a generous subsidy to their leaders."

 SGL_stringent_anti_corruption_measures_desc:0 "A culture of corruption took shape under Erik Prince, and having mixed with the corrupt practices of the Trade Councils of the Great Lakes, transparent government in the North East has long been relegated to the history books.

 SGL_support_small_businesses:0 "Support Small Businesses"
 SGL_support_small_businesses_desc:0 "The last few years have disrupted our economic framework to the core, and the liberation of the North East has not helped much.

 SGL_integrate_catholic_groups:0 "Integrate Catholic Groups"
 SGL_integrate_catholic_groups_desc:0 "Certain Catholic groups have caused a great deal of trouble for the People’s Commonwealth, but we may use them to our advantage. Holcomb can draw upon a few connections, and win over the more savoury elements of these former dissidents to shore up his rule."

 SGL_purge_white_phoenix_desc:0 "A terrorist band has used the power vacuum of war to establish itself even further in Holcomb’s home state of Indiana, waging war against the new government just as well as the old one. We do not negotiate with terrorists, and must crush them immediately."

 SGL_president_carson:0 "President Carson"
 SGL_president_carson_desc:0 "A long-time Republican, and a supporter of Erik Prince’s government, Ben Carson has now been elected.

 SGL_complete_decommunisation_desc:0 "What was started by President Prince needs to be taken even further.

 SGL_libertarian_tax_code_desc:0 "Taxation is theft! Every dollar we extract from the pockets of the people is a dollar stolen from the hard-working people of our country. We must slash taxes completely. The state can sustain its budget off of tariffs and donations from well-meaning citizens."

 SGL_reopen_the_stock_exchanges_desc:0 "We may have taken a lot of steps to restore the bounties of Capitalism to our country, but a key aspect has yet been forgotten.

A trick question - there are really none."
 FSS_orthodox_bushism:0 "Return To Bushism"
 FSS_orthodox_bushism_desc:0 "When George H.W. Bush led America through its darkest hour, he knew the union could only survive with an iron fist, not a velvet glove.

 FSS_randian_spirit_desc:0 "Ayn Rand taught us that the best way to prosperity was to remove the greedy hand of government from the economy entirely, letting businesses operate as they see fit. Only if the Atlases of the economy are given total freedom to do as they please can wealth be attained."
 FSS_ethical_egoism:0 "Ethical Egoism"
 FSS_ethical_egoism_desc:0 "It is not wrong to place one’s own self-interest above those of others. State-mandated altruism, on the other hand,is not only immoral but ultimately detrimental to society because it robs others of the chance to succeed via their own agency. If we want to truly value ourselves then we must fight for our own happiness."
 FSS_right_to_property_above_all:0 "Right To Property Above All"
 FSS_right_to_property_above_all_desc:0 "There is no right that eclipses the right to property. Through private property, the government is disempowered, and each man is made the free sovereign of his own little piece of land.

 FSS_correct_social_policies:0 "Correct Progressive Policies"
 FSS_correct_social_policies_desc:0 "We are not authoritarians, hell-bent on imposing an agenda of traditionalism, but many of the progressives' more radical social ideas passed by Wellstone and Hortman are authoritarian themselves.

 FSS_to_spread_freedom:0 "To Spread Freedom"
 FSS_to_spread_freedom_desc:0 "If we just consign ourselves to freedom within our own borders, it will inevitably be threatened by dictators and statists abroad. No, we must commit ourselves to the defense of freedom not just at home, but abroad as well."

 FSS_war_on_communism_desc:0 "Communism is cut from a cloth of evil, promoting an ideology of collectivism that would seek to eradicate the differences in class that make human ingenuity and self-reliance so important. Such actions go against human nature and freedom, and must be removed from our politics."
 FSS_war_on_fascism:0 "A War On Fascism"
 FSS_war_on_fascism_desc:0 "National socialism is the antithesis of civil, capitalist government, from its hardline support of collectivist, racist attitudes to its relentless pursuit of authoritarianism.

 FSS_eradicate_socialist_unions:0 "Eradicate Socialist Unions"
 FSS_eradicate_socialist_unions_desc:0 "One must recognize that in our current society, unions are not voluntary organizations built on freedom and organization.

 FSS_mastery_over_congress:0 "Congressional Mastery"
 FSS_mastery_over_congress_desc:0 "Paul Ryan served in congress as DeVos's whip and a high-ranking party boss, and now, he controls the entirety of a new Republican apparatus.

 FSS_haven_for_business:0 "An Executive's Safe Haven"
 FSS_haven_for_business_desc:0 "Galt’s Gulch was envisioned as a safe haven for wealth creators, far away from the greedy hands of government. Although it was mere fiction, it shall be no longer!

 FSS_fossil_fuel_industry:0 "Fossil Fuel Craze"
 FSS_fossil_fuel_industry_desc:0 "Socialist environmentalists decry fossil fuels, but their blue-sky fantasies of solar panels everywhere aside, who are we to restrict bold entrepreneurs from providing cheap and efficient power through fossil fuels?

 FSS_the_sweat_of_ones_brow_desc:0 "Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? "No," says the man in Philadelphia, "it belongs to the poor." "No," says the man in the Vatican, "it belongs to God." "No," says the man in Moscow, "it belongs to everyone." In the Great Lakes, however, all those answers are rejected - in favor of an impossible yet tangible ideal - freedom."

 FSS_the_patriot:0 "The Patriot"

 FSS_reject_the_militia_label_desc:0 "For our rule to be as frictionless as can be, it’s necessary to clean our movement’s image. Primarily, our bad image comes from the ‘militia’ label some give to us. We must reject it and seek legitimization. Soon the people will know that we are not terrorists, but patriots in the very same mold as the Sons of Liberty."
 FSS_purge_the_michigan_clique:0 "Purge The Michigan Clique"
 FSS_purge_the_michigan_clique_desc:0 "Even though we once considered them allies, Matt Savino’s Michigan Militia Corps is a dangerous organization full of untrustworthy, undisciplined people holding overly violent beliefs.

 FSS_introduce_loyalty_oath_desc:0 "The threat of our country backsliding into authoritarian centralism just like the old United States did over the 19th and 20th centuries is very real.

 FSS_libertarians_in_government:0 "Libertarians In Government"
 FSS_libertarians_in_government_desc:0 "Our government has been dominated by statist drones and wannabe bureaucratic tyrants for far too long.

"
 FSS_the_new_confederation:0 "Vanderboegh's Confederation"
 FSS_the_new_confederation_desc:0 "The Confederation that was promised in the referendum was nothing but a cheap impostor of the original.

 FSS_superian_constitutional_convention_desc:0 "Now that the socialists have been removed from government, it is time to turn our attention to another pressing issue.

 FSS_threaten_socialists:0 "Threaten Socialists"
 FSS_threaten_socialists_desc:0 "Unfortunately, not everyone celebrates their liberation from the old Hortman government.

 FSS_extreme_decentralization:0 "Extreme Decentralization"
 FSS_extreme_decentralization_desc:0 "Ceding all power to Milwaukee has been a clear mistake, allowing dictators such as Melissa Hortman to brutally repress patriots all across the country.

 FSS_implement_libertarian_theories_desc:0 "The freer the markets, the freer the people. The state has nothing to say about the free conduct of capitalism, and should mind its own business instead.

 FSS_deregulate_industry:0 "Deregulate Industry"

 FSS_condemn_non_christians_desc:0 "Those that reject the word of Christ our lord are not to be trusted. Their moral failings will only lead them into sin, or worse, to corrupt society around them.

 FSS_militias_as_paramilitaries_desc:0 "The disorganised militias that helped topple the Hortman government may have been enough then, but with subversive leftists still abounding in our society, it is clear that we need something more if we are to protect our society.

 FSS_thin_blue_line:0 "A Thin Blue Line"
 FSS_thin_blue_line_desc:0 "We could not be where we are without our fellow patriots in law enforcement.

 FSS_crush_ethnic_supremacists:0 "Crush Ethnic Supremacists"
 FSS_crush_ethnic_supremacists_desc:0 "Unlike other factions in the movement, the Wolverines have always welcomed everyone no matter what their race or religion is.

 FSS_stamp_out_the_traitors_desc:0 "While would-be tyrants like Ryan obviously had to be disposed of, we are now faced with the more difficult task of rooting out subversive traitors in our own movement.

 ### EVENTS ###
 greatlakes.1.t:0 "A Republic on the Brink"
 greatlakes.1.d:0 "In 2001, President Paul Wellstone, the newly inaugurated leader of the Great Lakes Confederation, began plans to abolish the weakened Confederation, which had given all four states in the Great Lakes equal status within the nation.\n\nAfter a period of political instability and multiple changes of government, the confederal system was blamed as the root cause for all this inefficiency and chaos. Numerous old American parties collapsed, with their successors eventually consolidating into two major parties: the Democratic Alliance, a progressive group of legislators who supported a transition to a unitary republic, and the Republican Party, a conservative party that sought to maintain the traditional Confederation.\n\nEventually, the plans to make the Great Lakes into a unitary republic were fully realized, but now, more than eight years later, in the second term of Melissa Hortman, opposition is begining to rise again to the unitary republic. Supporters of a newly-galvanized Libertarian Party, the Republican Party, and the Industrial Workers of the World, a union and political party many have accused of being a front for pro-APC activity, have all expressed support for the restoration of the Confederation. Even worse, a militant right-wing movement, small and numbers but vocal in its militant opposition to the Hortman government has risen. Many believe it to not be a threat, but if the cards are played incorrectly in the game of the Great Lakes Republic, our stable democracy could become rather unstable."
 greatlakes.1.o1:0 "Long live the Great Lakes!"
 greatlakes.2.t:0 "New Year Recess Ends"
 greatlakes.2.d:0 "Following the traditional recess of the Great Lakes House of Representatives during the holiday and new year season, the congresspeople of all parties have returned to their seats, officially marking the start of the 2010 legislative session.\n\nPresident of the Great Lakes Republic Melissa Hortman opened with a speech about ensuring that economic justice and the stability of the unitary republic was upheld, which was met with mixed reception from a House completely polarized on her democratic socialist policies. When she left, Republicans and Libertarians immediately attempted to try and introduce new bills to the floor of the House, most of them involving the privatization of vital industry or the re-establishment of the Confederation. As Hortman's Democratic Alliance holds a majority in the House with the support of most Representatives from North Michigan and Minnesota, most of the common bills that mark the start of the legislative session are often solely ceremonial, but, as the saying goes, it never hurts to try."
 greatlakes.2.o1:0 "We have work to do, all of us!"
 greatlakes.3.t:0 "Libertarians Put Forward 4th Confederal Referendum Bill"
 greatlakes.3.d:0 "Following five largely ceremonial resolutions, Bill H.R.6 has been introduced to the House floor today by Libertarian Representative Justin Amash of North Michigan, a barely-edited version of the past year's Confederal Referendum Bill. The bill, whose tenets have at this point been memorized by every single congressperson in the governing body, calls for a public referendum on the restoration of the Great Lakes Confederation. While the majority regime of the Democratic Alliance has traditionally opposed efforts to recreate the Confederation at any cost, general electoral trends against the ruling party have left them vulnerable to opposition from the Libertarians and the IWW, who have continued to advocate for the libertarian principles of the four-state confederation.\n\nGroans filled the room at the introduction of the bill, especially from Republican politicians, who have maintained a policy of neutrality on the issue for years, and DA politicians, who built the unitary republic in the first place. Although the DA still holds a majority to prevent the bill from passing, the Libertarians have continued to make a show of introducing the bill every year to show how dedicated they are to the principles of the Confederation and its decentralized government."
 greatlakes.3.o1:0 "Do they have nothing better to do?"
 greatlakes.3.o2:0 "See that it dies in committee."
 greatlakes.4.t:0 "Republicans Refuse To Support Bill"
 greatlakes.4.d:0 "Following the introduction of H.R.6, the 4th Confederal Referendum Bill, many in the Democratic Alliance had expected that Republicans would support the bill just as a show of opposition against the ruling party. However, this could not have been further from the truth.\n\nRepresentatives from Wisconsin Paul Ryan and Scott Walker, both supporting the party line of neutrality on the issue of the former Confederation, we believe, were instrumental in seeing Republican support for the endeavour end. Establishment Republicans, in a show of force against the Libertarians, voted against any hope of officially introducing the bill to Congress or the referendum to the people unanimously, and Justin Amash's 4th Confederal Restoration Bill was eventually shot down. With only the IWW, some Democratic Alliance defectors, and the Libertarians voting in favor of Amash's proposal, it seems the tradition of a ceremonial referendum bill has once again gone as expected."
 greatlakes.4.o1:0 "Glad to see some opposition has some sense."
 greatlakes.5.t:0 "Amash Pressured To Withdraw Bill"
 greatlakes.5.d:0 "Before the 4th Confederal Referendum Bill was even voted on, it was killed.\n\nFollowing the orders of Hortman, Democratic Alliance politicians filibustered, introduced their own lavish amendments to the bill which would see hours of time added on to the process, and, Amash alleges, threatened him personally with harsh measures if he did not rescind the bill. Although the practices employed by the DA have been criticized by observers and the general public, they have suceeded in removing any hope of a 4th Confederal Restoration Bill even going up for a vote."
 greatlakes.5.o1:0 "Harsh, but necessary."
 greatlakes.6.t:0 "Scott Boman Resigns As Libertarian Leader"
 greatlakes.6.d:0 "Following the complete and utter failure of H.R.6 in Congress, longtime Great Lakes Libertarian leader Scott Boman has resigned his position, calling for a leadership election within two months. Although he contributed to the rise of the Libertarian Party in the Great Lakes and its eventual merger with the Minnesota branch of the party, Boman failed to galvanize moderates and liberals to support the party, and would never gain the coveted 20% election threshold that was part of his leadership platform for years.\n\nWith a large-scale Libertarian loss in their once strong heartland of North Michigan to the Republican Party and the Democratic Alliance, even though it was offset by gains in Minnesota, Boman had already been pressured to resign by many in his party.\n\nBoman's positions of supplanting mainstream Libertarianism as an alternative to the Republican and Democratic Alliance establishments culminated in a strong and stable party, but that stability might soon fade when the leadership election arrives. No members of the party have yet announced their candidacy, but many have their eyes on Minnesota Repersentative and former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, along with Justin Amash, the original proposer of the 4th Confederal Restoration Bill, as his possible sucessors."
 greatlakes.6.o1:0 "The patriarch has fallen."
 greatlakes.7.t:0 "Protests In Iowa"
 greatlakes.7.d:0 "Protests over the socialist government in Milwaukee and the failure of the government to put the issue of the Great Lakes Confederation up to the people has led to mass protests in Iowa, backed by the militia movement in Michigan. Our military forces have estimated that the militia movement, which promotes a heavily nationalistic, libertarian, and anti-socialist outlook, has significant support in Iowa as well as in Michigan, mostly due to a general anti-socialist and pro-Confederation outlook there.\n\nRepublican representative Steve King was the only major politician to speak in support of protests, declaring that "Someone has to stand up against the overreach of a secular, socialist government headed by these Minnesota elites."\n\nAlthough a police response is expected in Des Moines, the protests in support of a Confederation might spread across the country, and the militia movement's influence on them could spell nationwide turmoil."
 greatlakes.7.o1:0 "The militia movement? Behind all this?"
 greatlakes.8.t:0 "Protests Expand To Minnesota"
 greatlakes.8.d:0 "Following the pro-confederation, militia-backed protests in Iowa, the general anti-government movement has spread to Minneapolis, where Libertarians, Republicans, and the IWW have taken up the struggle to advocate for a second referendum, and in more radical circles, the downfall of the Hortman government entirely.\n\nNational security advisors are currently being counselled by the Democratic Alliance leadership as the protests escalate, and many have suggested the government listen to further proposals on a referendum. Although many of the protestors, if not all of them, seem to support democracy as a whole, the radical influences on the pro-confederation movement, such as those from the nationalist militia movement, have instilled fear in the minds of many in our government.\n\nWe must deal with this soon, lest the Hortman government face even more opposition due to the people's fatigue with a socialist government. Although approval ratings still paint our government as leader of the House of Representatives in the future, a minority in the next election could lead to a referendum being all but guaranteed."
 greatlakes.8.o1:0 "You are playing right into fascist hands!"
 greatlakes.9.t:0 "The Confederation Pledge"
 greatlakes.9.d:0 "In a highly publicized address to the people and his party, candidate for Libertarian Party leader and Representative for Minnesota Jesse Ventura announced his "Confederation Pledge".\n\n"If there is not a Confederation as this nation's government by the next election, you can bet I will resign the first opportunity I can, because I will not let 3 more years of Hortman's authoritarian, elitist government come between the people and their rights," Jesse said in the broadcast, "You, the people of the Great Lakes, have an obligation for me to restore libertarian governance to this great nation, and I will do so. The truth is that neither party of the duopoly of Republicans and the Democratic Alliance has any interest in listening to your viewpoints as a human, only as a subject."\n\nThe speech was incredibly well-received, with Ventura's approval in the Libertarian Party rising high above Justin Amash's, who declined to comment on if he was willing to make a similar pledge."
 greatlakes.9.o1:0 "Well, then he will just have to resign!"
 greatlakes.10.t:0 "Hortman Responds"
 greatlakes.10.d:0 "In a largely panned counter-address to Jesse Ventura's Confederation Pledge, Hortman found it necessary to attack him on many of Ventura's character issues instead of pointing out the issues with the Confederation, which she claimed later she had done enough of.\n\nIn the speech, Hortman mentioned Ventura's previous lack of support for the actual people he claimed to represent, mentioning his lack of congressional attendance and large media presence, which she claimed ran contrary to his populist rhetoric that he was "serving the people" and truly had an obligation to them. In the most controversial part of the address, Hortman claimed that much of Ventura and his supporters' rhetoric towards her classified as that of the same sexists that occupied the Republican party, describing his persona as "macho" and "harmful to civil, political discourse for women all across the legislature".\n\nAlthough advocacy groups praised Hortman's comments, it did little to appease libertarian supporters of the Confederation, who labelled her speech as an assault on men and especially Ventura's character."
 greatlakes.10.o1:0 "You can do better than that!"
 greatlakes.11.t:0 "Ventura Ascends To Leadership"
 greatlakes.11.d:0 "In a landslide victory among registered Libertarians in the Great Lakes, Jesse Ventura, staunch advocate for a Great Lakes Confederation, and driven populist, has secured the leadership of the Great Lakes Libertarian Party in place of Scott Boman. His opponent, Representative Justin Amash, finished a distant second, and associated libertarian and anarcho-capitalist thinkers who criticized Ventura for his alleged statism ended far below both Amash and Ventura.\n\nA former wrestler who eventually joined the political scene during the crisis that led to the establishment of the Confederation, Ventura has been a staunch opponent of what he calls political parties concerned only with "their agendas and their pork", the Republican Party and the Democratic Alliance. A staunch populist and anti-elitist, Ventura has remained a popular politician among the entire Great Lakes Republic, and some polls even place him above the Republican Party in a possible election campaign.\n\nWhatever his personal positions may be, the Libertarian Party shall surely benefit from such a flamboyant character leading their party, who has managed to attract public opinion even from those outside the libertarian sphere of politics. His staunch support for the Confederation and states' rights have left even many progressives to back him as an anti-authoritarian choice against the ever-elitist DA."

 greatlakes.12.t:0 "King Declares Government "Might Be Replaced Soon""
 greatlakes.12.d:0 "In a political rally involving his Iowa constituents, Representative Steve King was accused of making comments labelled both inflammatory and dangerous by many even within the Republican Party.\n\nSpeaking to an Iowa crowd in support of his re-election as a Republican candidate in the region, King declared that the Hortman government was incompetent and more concerned with filling the government's pockets with the people's money instead of actually pursuing what really matters - Christian values, free-market capitalism, and pride in their country.\n\n"An attitude of white guilt has certainly shaped this nation," King said to a cheering crowd of supporters of the Confederation and of his candidacy last night, "We have women like Melissa Hortman, who continue to give all these concessions to these activist groups under the guise of advocacy and action, but what they're doing is simply funding revolutionary socialists and withholding money from the people who need it the most."\n\n"You all here are suffering from a broken poltical system which means to strengthen the profits of greedy socialists in Milwaukee, and if this attitude continues, I can tell you, the militias, the Christians, the common farmer of the West - the Hortman government might be replaced soon with all this pent-up anger.""

 greatlakes.13.t:0 "Hortman Holds Press Release"
 greatlakes.13.d:0 "With the government of the Democratic Alliance coming under consistent fire from populist groups both on the left and right, and tension from radical militia groups and labor activists erupting towards the Hortman administration, the ruling party has found it necessary to give a press release surrounding new terms for the referendum.\n\nIn a move universally praised by her opposition, President Melissa Hortman declared that a referendum on the restoration of the Great Lakes Confederation would be officially held in the coming months, and that each and every citizen would be able to cast a ballot for or against the confederation.\n\nTheir demands largely met, protests began to dissipate across the country, although militia groups pledged that they would continue to rally against the Hortman government's socialist policies, with the actual restoration of the Confederation meaning little to them."

 greatlakes.14.t:0 "King And DeVos Spar Over Policy"
 greatlakes.14.d:0 "On the issue of the Confederation, the Great Lakes' largest opposition party has been supremely divided. While Christian populists and those with more libertarian leanings have called for the abolishment of the Republic in favor of a Confederation that can ensure states' rights, party leader Betsy DeVos has traditionally taken the middle ground, declaring that removing vestiges of socialism and Commonwealth influence from the Great Lakes is more important then its form of government.\n\nHowever, many in the party have disagreed, but with the rigid amount of party control that the party whips have held over the Republicans, many cannot directly vote for pro-Confederation legislation. Many libertarians such as Paul Ryan in the party have stayed quiet, but Steve King's open support for the protests in favor of the Confederation and sometimes directly involved with the militia movement have led Republicans to re-open the Confederation debate.\n\nDeVos, in a harsh critique of King's positions, declared that the Republicans should always stand as a moral alternative to socialism, not one that aligns with undemocratic militias and supports radical changes to the political system. Many in the party, it seems, do not agree with that assessment."

 greatlakes.15.t:0 "Hortman Holds Private Meeting With Advisors"
 greatlakes.15.d:0 "Last night, President Hortman held a meeting with prominent members of the Democratic Alliance, and the news has reported a claim that Hortman will resign if the referendum results in a Pro-Confederation vote.\n\nBelieving a "Yes" vote to also be a "No" vote on Hortman's leadership, the President has decided to call a leadership election for the presidency but also the head of the Democratic Alliance as a party, a position Hortman currently holds, if the referendum does not go her way.\n\nHopefully, a leadership election after a pro-Confederation vote would not sabotage the Republic, but there is no way of truly knowing until the leadership election happens. Even that, however, rests on an anti-republic vote, which the government and polling suggests will not happen any time soon."
 greatlakes.15.o1:0 "One more reason to win this referendum."
 greatlakes.16.t:0 "King Under Fire For Comments"
 greatlakes.16.d:0 "Representative Steve King of the Republican Party has always been one for controversy, with his ties to militias and associated other pro-capitalist, anti-government movements, but now, the pressure has been mounting for the party establishment to finally do something about the unabashed Christian nationalist.\n\nNumerous controversial comments surrounding King have been brought up again by the media with his recent rise to public prominence, and many of them have been found disturbing. Comments surrounding Representative King's views on Montana during a Hortman's policy, such as the claim that "They're not all Adolf Hitler out there. All things considered, I think what they truly want is a society that is at least culturally homogeneous, where all of their children can truly grow up to be Montanans and Americans."\n\nAlthough King has expressed that the statement was not an endorsement of white nationalist politics, the Representative's other claims surrounding white identity, such as the claim that "the Muslim immigration in the Great Lakes has just been harrowing, and at this point, you have politicians who have no interest in even integrating into American culture running the Democratic Alliance. It is certainly cause for alarm, and I think all Christian, white Americans should be watchful for the future."\n\nEven within the party many have called to censure King and remove him from party positions, but only time will tell what DeVos's response will be."
 greatlakes.16.o1:0 "Will the Republicans act?"
 greatlakes.17.t:0 "Republicans Censure King"
 greatlakes.17.d:0 "In response to King's radical comments surrounding Islam, nationalism, and the Hortman government, party leader Betsy DeVos, along with Wisconsin higher-ups such as Paul Ryan and Scott Walker, have decided to censure King, and remove him from all current committee assignments. Although most committees are controlled by the Democratic Alliance, the removal has come as a staunch blow to King and any Republican who would dare express nationalist views contrary to the party establishment.\n\nNumerous groups in the Great Lakes applauded the move, with even prominent Libertarians such as Ventura and Amash expressing their satisfaction at the move. "Racism is not welcome here, and nor is the toxic Christian nationalism that King espouses," Libertarian leader Ventura remarked, and most in the Great Lakes seem to agree with him.\n\nHowever, King has connections in the party, especially with representatives from Iowa and even in private militias. Perhaps the Republican Party has opened an even bigger can of worms..."
 greatlakes.17.o1:0 "Good!"
 greatlakes.18.t:0 "King Forms Christian People's Party"
 greatlakes.18.d:0 "With the support of multiple other Iowa representatives, Steve King has formed the Christian People's Party in opposition to Republican views on immigration, the Confederation referendum, and other social values espoused by the Republican Party. In addition, King cited the opinion that the Republican Party had too far strayed from Christian and conservative values that were once embraced in the time before the Libertarian Party. King, believing the Republican Party had moderated on social issues to appease the centrist party, claimed the Republicans were too far gone, and that his censure was only the beginning of the party's decline.\n\nAlthough it is possible that Steve King's eventual efforts to create a Christian and nationalist party in the Great Lakes will result in victory in the Referendum and the rise of the party, the number of Republican legislators who actually joined onto his movement has been low."

From more politically libertarian liberals to those emphasizing with the IWW, the Democratic Alliance has now been relatively united under the prospect of a shared socialist agenda for the Great Lakes.\n\nThe issue of the Confederation has, for now, been put aside by the politicians of all parties except perhaps the Libertarian Party, and the Democratic Alliance can now fully set their sights on a socialist dream first proposed by this region's leaders during the 1910s and 20s."

Although the IWW and other radical left organizations have rallied for cooperatives and increased support for community policing and militia crackdowns, it seems that the Hortman government's progressive platform is widely popular among the left, who has feared that the Democratic Alliance shall become the Democratic Party once again."

The economic support, which involved mutual investment in each other's economies and an open border agreement along the Minnesota-Ontario border, created a friendly atmosphere between our two nations - now, many hawks are suggesting we arm ourselves to prepare for a possible opportunistic attack without fear of Canadian retaliation.\n\nWith our international ratings among electoral organizations downgraded from free to questionable, it is clear that the outcry over our recent policy measures has now been largely justified in the eyes of the international community. While Hortman has explained that recent measures designed to crack down on voter fraud and ensure electoral integrity were just that, but many, especially in the conspiratorial ranks of the Libertarian Party, continue to disagree, with leader Ventura calling any future elections under our laws "a complete sham"."

With our government becoming more and more radically leftist against a large-scale libertarian and capitalist movement, the Hortman administration has deemed it important to create a new media that can surely support socialist values and condemn the capitalists that have taken hold of the industry.\n\nToday, bills led by the Democratic Alliance calling for the creation of the Great Lakes Broadcasting Corporation, a public and state media outlet financed and run by the government and its workers."

Because of the general tendency towards left-wing values that many prominent celebrities hold, the Hortman government has undergone a policy to have them promote getting out to vote for left-wing candidates, and even if they just support a general proposal to vote, gains for the left will still be made because of the general left-wing values of young voters.\n\nYouth activism, eventually, however, could turn against the establishment, and the Young DA could quickly advocate for more progressive policies than the federal DA can actually stand to implement."

Thousands of weapons from sources in the American People's Commonwealth and Montana have been located, with many in our armed forces suspecting that the militias were only years away from launching a possible coup against the government, especially with sympathy from much of the Christian right.\n\nDue to our efforts, however, most major outposts have been raided and destroyed, and what remained of militia land is now officially under the control of the Great Lakes Republic and its brave soldiers.

African-American activists have continually pressured for an end to the Great Lakes Republic's military and police overreach, especially under the Hortman administration. The issue of police brutality has been raised by Libertarians and the IWW both, leading the Hortman government to announce the "Great Lakes Police Action Plan".\n\nRemoving overly conservative police chiefs and cracking down on a culture of violence in the force, the GLPAP seeks to reform the police force into a well-equipped and trained national force that can handle insurrection from militias and foreign actors without the ill training of the previous police force, which many believe led to police brutality. Cries for community policing, however, have increased even with Hortman's legislation passed.

Fred Upton, a moderate Libertarian willing to compromise on economic issues with the DA, was condemned by the establishment, but may increase the party's legitimacy among the two major parties. Michael Badnarik, a staunch Libertarian thinker associated with anarcho-capitalism, has gained the support of many in the party establishment, although many doubt his appeal across the political spectrum.

Chuck Grassley of Iowa has positioned himself as the main loyalist to the Republican position, claiming he will toe the line between nationalist and libertarian while bringing both into the party. A staunch fiscal conservative from Iowa, many have reservations with Grassley's age and ties to the American Republic, but none can doubt his commitment to republicanism. Paul Ryan, a staunch fiscal conservative and another right-wing Republican, has advocated for a stronger and more hardline party that can challenge socialism. His controversial "Freedom Plan" would revitalize capitalism in the Great Lakes by privatizing large swathes of society. Norm Coleman of Minnesota has inserted some of his state's progressivism into his campaign, declaring that the Republican Party needs to be moderate to represent the needs of the DA and Libertarians.

Populists, especially those from Wisconsin and Iowa, have rallied around Russ Feingold, an heir of the Wellstone tradition and a staunch supporter of economic leftism. A dark horse candidate, however, but one with much support in the establishment, is Mark Dayton, briefly President during the crises that rocked the Confederation during its early days. Promising a return to farmer-labor-style politics and a more moderate progressive vision to the left of Hortman and right of Feingold, Dayton has secured himself as a viable candidate among two wings vying for control."

Now, the CPP has accepted the Republican desire for unification, and with a whimper, the age of Steve King's third party has ended. Many Christian People's Party leaders were former Republicans themselves and had no issue merging into the party. Some were even given committee assignments as soon as they returned to the party, but Steve King himself was blacklisted from numerous committees and Republican electoral organizations.\n\nMany expect the Republicans to mount a primary challenge, although many fear a hostile attitude toward King will cause a party such as the CPP to rise up again."

Also a key point of Hortman's speech was a recognition for the Great Lakes' LGBT community, traditionally threatened by conservative social structures across America.\n\nAlthough the speech served little except to galvanize members of the DA's most loyal base, the Hortman government hopes that a commitment to social progressivism will help rally young leftists, who traditionally do not vote in Great Lakes presidential elections.

Believing the referendum to be illegitimate, numerous libertarian, right-wing, and even far-right organizations based out of Michigan, Iowa, and possibly Montana have joined in a nationwide protest against the socialist presidency.\n\nWith the Democratic Alliance's rule already secure over the nation, it seems like these militia protests might end inconclusively, but there is always a possibility that they become so emboldened that their demands will be etched in the politics of the Great Lakes forever.\n\nWith leaders such as Steve King openly endorsing the protests and Jesse Ventura calling the anti-Hortman message "a just one", it seems as if there will be no end to the cries and whining of our opposition..."

 greatlakes.55.d:0 "Unfortunately, the anti-Hortman movement is clearly not limited to the crazies who make up the bulk of the militia movement. Our nation's Sheriffs, often far-right authoritarians in the same vein of the militias, have always opposed what they claim to be our government's abuse of power and curtailing of regional authority.\n\nNow, with protests once again rocking Michigan, they have joined them, declaring that our government must delegate significant autonomy to Sheriffs and local officials in Michigan and Iowa. Both right-wing states, the people of northern Michigan and Iowa have consistently opposed our government's methods and ideology, and it is no surprise their sheriffs are rallying against us.\n\nHowever, many in our nation suspect that even sheriffs in Minnesota and Wisconsin oppose our rule, and that we must be careful in deciding steps to deal with these militiamen and their new allies."

Now, sheriffs, many ruling in areas not effected by protests for further autonomy, such as Minneapolis and Wisconsin, have supported the actions of the sheriffs who were fired by the government.\n\nCalling for those fired for rallying with the militia groups to be re-instated, Milwaukee sheriff David Clarke declared that "liberal policies" had led to the riots and rallies, and that the militias were protecting their constitutional rights. With sheriffs across the country now promoting conservative, nationalist beliefs and standing in solidarity with the fired sheriffs, it seems that protests might soon escalate to other areas.\n\nOur army has declared it a low risk situation and in a statement in Milwaukee claimed that "civilized government will once again prevail, and that in weeks these rioters will be off the streets"."

His words were met with applause by many of the protesters there, whom many in our government believe to be associated directly with the militia movement and other treasonous organizations. Although the Democratic Alliance has introduced legislature into the House to censure and condemn Christian People's Party politicians who outwardly support militia positions and rhetoric, said legislation will not be pushed through the House until this time of national crisis ends.\n\nFor now, the government will have to deal with the North Michigan politicians who have rallied around the libertarian and right-wing populist banner, to the dismay of all progressive citizens of the Republic."

 greatlakes.58.d:0 "Disturbing news has reached the President. Apparently, sheriffs in Michigan have refused to vacate their positions, and many in local law enforcement and government have refused to act on government warrants to remove traitorous sheriffs who have joined and allied with the militia movement. All over North Michigan, Iowa, and even Wisconsin, sheriffs and their underlings have entered into a pact not to sell each other out to the Great Lakes government.\n\nWith this act of defiance against the very government of the Great Lakes that they were supposed to serve, Hortman has announced that loyal national guardsmen will be send through the panhandle. When approached about potential liberal national guardsmen already serving in North Michigan, Hortman activated their orders too, telling them to apprehend and search for any sheriff allying with the militia movement or directly defying against governmental operations and orders in the region.\n\nAlthough military leaders such as General Joseph Votel were considered for deployment into cities that have been "overtaken by the militia virus", it was decided that the national guard would be the only military force in Michigan with the order of rooting out the sheriffs who have become such a problem for our government in recent weeks."

Although most militia members are visibly armed, many have refrained from actually attacking counter-protesters or the guard, although it is believed if the militia continues to hold their guard in barricaded towns violence will follow.\n\nEven worse for our government and the national guard campaign is the fact that numerous towns, especially those controlled by Libertarian and Republican mayors, have given militia protesters and right-wing activists full control of city resources in order to continue their protests for "freedom and liberty". General Joseph Votel has asked Hortman once again if he has leave to activate the military to crush militia-controlled areas, and this time, it appears Hortman will let him work his magic..."

The Sheriff of Milwaukee, in his first address to the people of the Great Lakes, declared that the "Republic will know peace and liberty once more once the socialist traitors who have run this country into the ground are finally dealt with". Many in the Democratic Alliance's political establishment, too afraid to speak out against this new military dictator, have fled the country or retired to their homes. As for the militia movement, no one in the nation is quite sure what Clarke's ties with them entail, or if he is also opposed to them as threats to the Great Lakes Republic.\n\nThe provisional presidency, however, is here to stay, and Clarke has already taken control of military operations in Michigan, urging the National Guard to return to the capital. Whether he is truly a champion of law and order bent on saving the Republic from militias or a puppet of them himself is yet to be revealed."

Although Mike Vanderboegh and even members of the Christian People's Party have defended the militias by claiming they are simply protesting peacefully, the unfortunate fact that many of these traitors are armed and dangerous during this time of national crisis is, for many in the legislature, enough cause for the suppression of their rallies and their movement.\n\nWith many militias directly supporting far-right policies and an overthrow of the government, although Vanderboegh denies this being his key goal, the deployment of the national guard is integral to preserving democracy in the Great Lakes Republic for years to come."

Following a path of constant disapproval of any move to remove their influence, militias continue to remain on the streets in counties across the Great Lakes Republic. Our national guard has already arrived at key hotspots of militia activity in North Michigan and Iowa, but many in our government are scared of radical action being taken against the militias.\n\n Libertarians have spearheaded an effort to "ensure the right to protest" of these groups, and leader Ventura urged Hortman to seek a diplomatic solution, perhaps by using a former militia member or affiliated politician as a negotiator. However, such a policy would make our government appear weak in the eyes of many Lakers, and the military itself has advised Hortman to simply go through with coordinated control efforts."

Instead, the national guard was able to beat them back from key barricaded positions in North Michigan and shatter the morale of many of the protest groups.\n\nSome in our government continue to fear our response, but with such a simple attack on militias successful, and public opinion already against radical far-right groups, it seems the efforts of the guard and the military have succeeded."

With the militia movement on the backfoot, the time is nigh to settle this matter once and for all. Already, the militia movement has promised to retaliate against such ‘unconstitutional government attacks’, but given the situation on the field, that is likely to be little more than bluster. Already, the Secretary of the Interior has compiled a list of identified participants, whom we could begin to arrest and charge for their seditious activities. Our hard response, however, has also caused many within Congress to admonish our government for heavy-handed measures. To win them over, it may be prudent to meet the remnants of the militia movement in the middle, and with our show of force in mind, hash out something that will keep them from ever carrying out such an act again. The choice is President Hortman’s."

Resistance has been scant, with the National Guard still keeping order in the streets and with many members of the militia having been discouraged by their defeat. As courts all across the country are preparing to file charges and process these numerous seditionists, the Secretary of the Interior is meanwhile preparing to fill out the numerous gaps in our law enforcement services opened by the sheriffs. It may be a while before the National Guard can demobilise, but we can rest assured that safety and security have returned to the Great Lakes Republic, now for good."

Although many in the government are thankful that we saved face by refraining to go on the offensive, we are left to wonder if we simply traded one humiliation for another. Already, average Lakers are joining in the celebrations, with everyone from Libertarians to supporters of the CPP mingling with the militias. This show of force has also disheartened many pro-government counter protesters, who have thrown down their picket signs and gone home, wondering just how the government could have let Vanderboegh win."

 greatlakes.67.d:0 "As the dust from the Militia rallies has begun to settle, it is clear to the Hortman administration that our hesitance has cost us victory. As public opinion is swinging in favour of the militia movement, Mike Vanderboegh has called on the government to accept defeat and demanded that we enter negotiations, a call readily supported by the vast majority of his supporters. It is clear that we are out of options, as ordering in the National Guard now would only undermine what support we have left in the country. While Hortman herself has refused to attend the negotiations, it appears that Secretary of State Steve Simons is more than willing to, so he will be the envoy. May he be able to save us some face."

Hortman declined to participate, saying it was "beneath her" and that she had "political duties", leaving the new Secretary to handle the talks.\n\nFortunately for the government, Vanderboegh's demands were rather reasonable, asking that all major militias be legalized as political and activist organizations, and that their right to protest and rally should not be infringed. Vanderboegh's demands also made sure to protect the rights of Sheriffs, traditionally right-wing officials, from government action, and in the most interesting point of the bill, called for the immediate passing of an executive order granting North Michigan autonomy of its own within the Republic.\n\nSimon was happy to accept the requests on behalf of the government, and it seems that soon, Vanderboegh, the CPP, and Libertarians will be pacified once more on the issue of autonomy and government overreach."

Michigan representatives in Milwaukee have largely been silent on the issue, but mayors of towns in the region have protested Hortman's efforts to solve the conflict in peaceful terms without directly reacting to the far-right protesters."

However, the sentiment has still been felt across the political right, centre, and even some in the left, who continue to call for the deployment of the National Guard and in extreme cases, the army."

These opposition leaders and more have proposed a motion that would formalize talks with the militias and would invite the President to speak directly with the leaders of the anti-government movement.

Already, frightening reports have begun to reach Clarke’s ear of the militia movement radicalising even further, as extremist voices begin to catch on among their movement.

As local governments all across the Great Lakes have declared their support, some more tentatively than others, for Sheriff Clarke, the militia movement have meanwhile cried for blood following this ‘betrayal.’ Although no direct confrontations have happened yet, it is clear to Clarke’s government that he needs to deal with the militias in some way sooner rather than later, lest our beautiful land be afflicted with more chaos and disorder."

A resounding success for the militia movement, it is clear that the old, socialistic constitution of the Great Lakes can no longer be applicable, and that a new one needed to be written, one that will genuinely respect the inalienable rights of the Lakers.

Stating that Clarke has pledged to uphold the freedoms that they struggled together for, Vanderboegh affirmed his trust in the Clarke administration, and urged his supporters to do the same.

Offering a number of cabinet positions to prominent members of the militia movement, including Mike Vanderbough himself, as a show of goodwill. That the Clarke administration and militia movement went from being rivals to allies in such a short time has taken observers by surprise, although some are noting that a dispute between movements of such similar ideological character could not possibly have lasted, especially not in such a tense region as the former United States."

With Walberg as speaker, Congress will presumably remain a puppet of Clarke's throughout the period of national re-organization as the country is reformed into a new Great Lakes Republic that can truly claim to unite all people of the lakes."

Therefore, to guarantee the security of the Free State of Superior, a massive hike in funds has been allocated to both local and state police, to forevermore safeguard law and order in this land. At the same time, President Clarke also signed into effect a new law that vastly expanded police powers, including extending the police’s right to detain without trial to 72 hours and drastically reducing the requirements needed to attain warrants. Despite protestations by liberal and socialist groups, President Clarke has assured the people of Superior these measures are essential to ensuring public safety."

Leftist parties have faced intimidation and in some cases outright banning and censoring after Clarke's numerous purges in the name of crushing leftist conspiracy, and so none are running this election.\n\nThe closest to any left-wing voice is Paul Upton's Libertarians, who have largely abandoned many of their radical political stances to act as a moderate, centrist voice supporting a return to normalcy.

Wellstone, 70 years old, confined to a wheelchair after the disease began to take its toll on his body, served as President for four years from 2001 to 2005, leading his newly-created party, the Democratic Alliance, to landslide victories against the dominant Republican Party. Renowned among Minnesotans and leftists across the Great Lakes, Wellstone dedicated his life to serving the people of his community with sweeping progressive legislation, but he is not without his controversy.\n\nWith his death, many have criticized him for the reforms that saw the Great Lakes Confederation reform into a Republic, even when Wellstone himself claimed that his broad social agenda meant much more to him than governmental restructuring. Already, the IWW and the Democratic Alliance have cooperated to hold a large-scale vigil defending his record on labor and social reform, with the President in Milwaukee rumored to be in attendance. Whatever the people of the Great Lakes feel about the structure of government he created, Wellstone remained a national hero for years after his presidency, and the progressive stalwart's legacy will surely not be forgotten."

Citing local opposition to the Hortman government, the unique geographical position of Michigan, and political struggles with the People's Commonwealth, Upton asked the Congress to consider a bill granting significant local autonomy to regional administrators.\n\nWith support from across the political spectrum, from the decentralization-supporting leftists of the IWW, Republicans looking to undermine the government, and of course libertarians, the only thing the bill needs to pass is Hortman's own signature."

Although many in the nation support Vanderboegh for his liberation of the tyrannical Hortmanite government and his willingness to work with libertarians, republicans, and Christians all, one could not help but notice his pale tone and sickly demeanour.

An oath to the constitution, the President, and the values of liberty and democracy was required for all incoming and current legislators, which states that they cannot pass any laws infringing upon constitutional freedoms. The President, acting largely as a traditional judicial branch in a functional democracy, has said he will pressure removal of any in Congress who "deprive the American people of their freedoms", as is his right as President."

While some had expected it to just be outreach, intended by Vanderboegh to legitimise his rule, it appears that there may be more to it. Following the meeting, it was announced that multiple members of the Libertarian Party, Badnarik included, were to take up important positions in Vanderboegh’s government.

With many militiamen either arrested, scattered or dead, it appears that Mike Vanderboegh has at long last secured his right flank from its radicals, allowing him to present a more human face to the militia movement untarnished by the radicals."

While the doctors are promising that the president will make a full recovery, his cancer shows no signs of remission, and some are worried that the President may die in hospital.

To the relief of the nation, however, President Vanderbough eventually recovered and was discharged, returning to Milwaukee posthaste upon his recovery. What awaits him is a government that has been perpetually on the edge, with the day-to-day management handled by Vice President Rod Blum, and one that was very well prepared for his premature death. Although President Vanderboegh has indicated that he is ready to take up the mantle of leadership once more, this may be an opportunity to ensure a smooth and stable transition of leadership.

However, in light of the President’s arduous recovery, it became increasingly clear that a future health crisis is certain to paralyse the government were Vanderbough to remain President. Therefore, after much deliberation in the administration, Mike Vanderboegh has decided to resign the office of president, passing the torch of leadership onto his vice president, Rod Blum. Formerly a member of the Christian People’s Party, Blum was brought into government by Vanderboegh shortly after the constitutional convention. The first leader not a member of the militia movement since Melissa Hortman, this transition of power seems to cement the slow but sure transition made towards civilian leadership since the coup, a transition that is certain to continue under Blum’s leadership. In a short speech to the nation, Rod Blum praised the outgoing president as a ‘true patriot’ and a ‘saviour of democracy’, promising to continue the line set under the Vanderboegh government."

Meeting with David Clarke, [Root.GetLeader] thanked the sheriff for preventing Melissa Hortman’s ‘diabolical seizure of power’ and allowing for ‘true patriotic forces’ to come to power. Although the sheriff appeared grateful for the support of the administration, it was clear to multiple observers that he yet carried a grudge over the affairs of the days after the ouster of the Hortman administration.

This proved untenable, however, and in response, [Root.GetLeader] has been quick to carry out extensive reform of the political system, formalising the militias’ role within the government hierarchy. While considered a mixed bag by many within and without the administration, most notably the more libertarian militias, who reject this subsumption into the government, it has already done much to solve the issues of overlapping authority.

As night fell upon Superior, militiamen all over the country prepared for just another night’s rest, but what met them upon their bedsides were their previously allied Christian Warriors of the Hutaree. The militias were swiftly decimated, with only scant resistance being put up offered up towards the Hutaree. By daybreak, streets all over Superior ran red with blood from the purged, while most militia leaders had been taken into custody, so that they could be made to repent their sins. The same morning, President Stone addressed the people, stating that a ‘necessary precaution against sinners in our midst’ had been undertaken, and that ‘all true Christians can now rest easy, knowing that these sinners had been dealt the Lord’s mercy’.

In the light of the Hortman government’s centralisation of power under the Presidency, however, it is clear that something must be done. With agreement from even recalcitrant delegates from the Democratic Alliance, it has been agreed that the Presidency will be disempowered, but to some, that is not enough. Joining the chorus of the IWW are the Libertarians, who want to transform the Presidency into a figurehead position. With the Democratic Alliance staying out of the debate, clearly humiliated, it falls to the rest of the delegates to define the limits of presidential power and just how extensively they should be disempowered."

With the questions of the presidency and of the legislature already being answered, the time has come to finish addressing the bounds of central power and of the judiciary, with the big question being whether the central government should ultimately be more, or less, powerful than the states in regards to legislature and courts, with some arguing that the nationwide Supreme Court should even be abolished. A loud and outspoken faction however, argues that the old Confederation was a failure, and that Confederalism no matter how nice it may seem does not hold the cure to the Republic’s ills, and that the best way forward lies in the middle, with federalism. Much like the old United States, this would mean that Milwaukee remains the most powerful authority in the country, although as always, the choice falls to the convention."

While the Democratic Alliance has certainly taken a beating with the defeat in the referendum, the party is not yet out, with its activists already gathering strength to campaign once more, to carve out their place in the confederal future of the Great Lakes.

The Democratic Alliance may be down, but it is not out, is aiming to still deliver a progressive leftist future for the Great Lakes; the Republican Party, long relegated to being the opposition, finally has a chance to restore the Great Lakes to their vision of patriotism and free enterprise; the Christian People’s Party, a right-wing populist party campaigning on ‘restoring God to government’ and claiming to be the only party with the guts to stand up to the Socialist ‘deep state’ in Milwaukee; and finally the Libertarian Party with its heterodox candidate, Jesse Ventura, which professes that it will restore freedom to the Great Lakes once and for all. With the right vote split, the Democratic Alliance stands a decent chance of reclaiming power, but they should be wary of underestimating their foes, for no two predictions agree on who the winner will be.

This victory was not easy, however, and in order for Steve Fletcher to claim the presidency, an alliance had to be formed with the more hardline leftists in the country. In order to win over this group, Fletcher has formed a coalition with the Industrial Workers of the World, a major socialist trade union with branches all across the former United States. Already Fletcher has fulfilled his promises, appointing several IWW figures to government offices. Courting the IWW is a somewhat controversial move, even for some leftists, as the IWW were the ones who established Chomsky’s American People’s Commonwealth. The idea of inviting them into the halls of government in the Great Lakes feels like a risk to many, as there is the possibility that their loyalties may not lie in total with the Great Lakes Commonwealth. Nevertheless, this coalition has secured the far left vote and won the election for the Democratic Alliance, granting the presidency to Steve Fletcher and ensuring that socialism will continue in the Great Lakes."

With the IWW affirmed in government, Fletcher has hoped to reach favourable agreements with President Chomsky relating to both nations' roles in the global economy and diplomatic sphere. Fletcher, a staunch proponent of détente with the President, has come under fire for his ties to the revolutionary socialists, but his visit to Philadelphia has proved fruitful. Already, there is talk of an official agreement of cooperation between the armies of the Great Lakes and Philadelphia, along with an official declaration of support for Fletcher's government, the first of Chomsky's endorsements in the history of the Great Lakes' presidential elections.\n\nAs Fletcher returns to Milwaukee to meet with his cabinet and discuss further social reforms, many are wondering if the Great Lakes might finally be safe from the wandering eye of Philadelphia, but even more are wondering if Fletcher has sold the Great Lakes out to an inevitable unifying force on the continent."

As such, many of these activists have continued to protest various issues, criticizing the Democratic Alliance as overly moderate or outright revisionist. To quell these protestors, Vice President Mark Pocan met with several activist leaders to clarify the current administration’s absolute support for socialist principles. During this meeting, Pocan made a variety of promises on the imminent policy of the Fletcher administration, with particular attention paid to the topics of police reform and economic equity. In return, these activist leaders have called for the end of protests for the time being, although they have promised that they will be back with a vengeance if the government doesn’t follow through on Pocan’s lofty promises."

This is a departure from the unitary republic that the Democratic Alliance has supported for almost the entirety of its existence, and a clear sign that the party has moved on since the days of the Hortman administration. This is primarily a move done out of pragmatism rather than out of genuine ideological change, with the Democratic Alliance hoping to avoid any sort of fiasco that could result in the fragmentation of the country, which has been a clear risk as of late. This has, naturally, assuaged the fears of many of the people who have spent the last several years rallying for a more decentralized form of government, but it comes as a disappointment to many in the farther reaches of the left, who fear that the reduction in centralized power will make it more difficult to develop and maintain socialism throughout the country."

 greatlakes.130.d:0 "This morning, President Fletcher unveiled a comprehensive police reform bill with the aims of reducing police violence and increasing the capacity of communities to protect and govern themselves. Under this new bill, police officers are only allowed to operate in communities that they already live in, helping to foster a close relationship between officers and the people that they’re meant to be protecting. In addition to this, community oversight committees will be instituted to help the community to deliver feedback regarding the actions of the police directly to the government. Ideally, this will help civilians hold the police accountable and force the police to take an interest in the daily ongoings of their communities. This bill has been received well by most people, with the exception of many police officers themselves, which is to be expected, as many officers are expected to either lose their jobs or be forced to relocate as a result of this legislation. However, the police have long been among the most vocal critics of the Democratic Alliance, and so this bill has still proven to be a net positive for Fletcher’s approval rating."

This move has been done in the name of promoting and protecting the freedom of speech and association. Fletcher has also outwardly expressed his eagerness to work with communists and reach a common ground with them for the betterment of the country. Already, several communist parties have begun to pop up all across the population, which, while small individually, potentially stand to represent a significant portion of the population collectively. Due to the small size and thus democratic unviability of these communst parties at the national level, Fletcher and the Democratic Alliance are hoping that these communists, many of whom had boycotted the most recent election, will find a sense of loyalty with the party that made their associations legal and help to keep them afloat in coming years. Others, however, believe that these scattered communist parties will eventually unify and prove to be a party big enough to split the left wing and sap a substantial number of votes from the Democratic Alliance."

 greatlakes.132.d:0 "In a press conference this afternoon, President Fletcher announced a major prison reform package, aimed at curbing the incarceration rates of non-violent criminals. Once the bill is implemented, the vast majority of non-violent crimes will no longer be offenses punishable by prison time, with most convictions for such crimes being reduced to fines or mandatory community service. Additionally, any currently prisoners jailed for these non-violent offenses are to be released from prison as soon as realistically possible. These prisoners are primarily drug addicts and dealers, with an additional mix of low-level thieves, fraudsters, and other criminals also being granted the opportunity to rejoin the rest of society. Fletcher’s hope is that the newly expanded social safety nets of the Great Lakes Confederation should be sufficient in preventing these people from turning to crime once again, though this trust has been labelled as naive and overly optimistic by many of Fletcher’s critics. The Democratic Alliance’s support base, on the other hand, is ecstatic on Fletcher’s follow-through of this campaign promise, and believes it will lay the groundwork for a more free society."

In light of the most recent tax hike, business owners all across the country have begun to give voice to their frustrations, arguing that Fletcher is intentionally hiking taxes on them as part of a plot to crush private business in the Great Lakes Confederation all together, as evidenced by the fact that worker cooperatives and government run firms are exempt from the vast majority of Fletcher’s new taxes. A number of pro-business protests have been organized, and many political figures sympathetic to capitalism have put their support behind these protests. Overall however, these expressions of business frustrations have been fairly small scale in the grand scheme of things, and Fletcher has largely ignored them. After all, the numbers are small, and the odds of them leaving the country are extremely low, given what the alternatives are."

Milwaukee is not the first city to be visited by growing communist political clout, but it is by far the largest, and a quite important development due to the city’s status as the nation’s capital. This falls in line with a growing trend throughout the Great Lakes Confederation, as far left groups have begun to rise to prominence in various local level elections, even claiming the mayor’s office of several smaller towns. Once seen as a radical, President Fletcher and his Democratic Alliance now by comparison look like somewhat reasonable moderates to many in the midst of this swell of radical leftism. The Democratic Alliance still remains the largest left wing political party in the country, however that may soon change if the far left manages to continue at their current growth rate, leading many to believe that the days of Democratic Alliance political dominance are numbered."

Fletcher’s coalition with the Industrial Workers of the World has actually done a significant degree of legwork on this front, as they wield a substantial amount of influence within the halls of power of the [NEA.Getname]. Additionally, Fletcher’s steady move to the left has brought his administration closer to ideological alignment with that of [NEA.GetLeader] than the last time Fletcher visited the [NEA.Getname].

Rising to the presidency is one Betsy Hodges, a longtime outsider of the Democratic Alliance, having been a vocal internal critic of the Hortman administration for much of her career. Already her government is shaping up to be a more diverse one than its predecessor, counting among its officials members of social democratic and other left-liberal parties. Notably, Hodges has refrained from making any sort of coalition with the farther left elements of the Great Lakes, such as the Industrial Workers of the World, much to the disappointment of many hardline socialists. While many of the Democratic Alliance’s old guard would have preferred that Steve Fletcher had won the nomination, they have since done their best to throw their weight behind Hodges’ new administration in order to maintain party stability. The clear takeaway is that Hodges’ government is to be a new page for the Democratic Alliance, one that takes pride in ideological diversity and anti-establishment sentiment."

The state, a center of Wellstone and Harkin's first electoral victory and Hortman's subsequent one in 2005, has recently fallen to the Republicans, the Libertarians, and now, the Christian People's Party in Congressional elections.

After the discussion, Hodges, not realizing her microphone was still on, declared loudly and accusingly that the voter was a "backwards hick who could care less about my actual record and more about some grandiose notion of leftist sabotage". Although it is believed Hodges will apologize to the insulted voter, the incident has ruined much of her goodwill in Iowa accumulated by the trip in the first place, and Republican and Libertarian media has already begun declaring her an out-of-touch elitist."

The ultimate goal of this initiative is a new, more broad party platform for the Democratic Alliance, moving it away from the dominance of democratic socialist ideological purity. In effect, this will make the party more viable for social democrats and left-liberals in addition to the progressive socialists and the Hortmanite old guard. That said, some have criticized this new party platform for its new sympathies towards comparatively conservative ideologies, as well as its watering down of more radical left wing movements. That said, many analysts project that this broadening of the party can only serve to bolster the influence of the Democratic Alliance, even if it may inadvertently move them slightly to the right."

With Hodges' reforms as Mayor largely extended to the whole of the Great Lakes Confederation, many have taken issue, especially police chiefs in conservative counties. Galvanized by the decentralized reforms of the Confederation, many Mayors have announced they will fight the police reform plans in their own territories, but fortunately for the President, urban centers that truly need the reforms have supported Hodges' measures, even if the police continues to grumble.\n\nThe platform of criminal justice and police reform, the most concrete in the history of the Confederation, shall crush the remaining effects of the conservative drug war and significantly liberalize the prison apparatus."

Although Hodges has often painted Hortman as the very image of the establishment that she’s endeavored so hard to fight against, their meeting has made it clear that the issue was less political and more personal, with the two women having a clash of personalities that clearly has gone a bit too far. During today’s public broadcast, the former rivals did their best to appear to be on good terms, with each listing a slew of accomplishments that they admire the other for. That said, many who watched the broadcast noted that the meeting still seemed a bit tense, leading some to draw the conclusion that it was merely the result of the Democratic Alliance Unity Commission trying to, as the name might suggest, foster unity in an increasingly diverse party. This broadcast has also coincided with President Hodges’ easing of populist rhetoric, and an increased willingness on her part to cooperate with the Democratic Alliance establishment. Regardless as to the true intent behind this broadcast, it does seem to have eased tensions between the various wings of the Democratic Alliance."

With Hodges’ successful expansion of the Democratic Alliance’s ideological coalition and the apparent popularity of her platform, it should come as no surprise that the Unity Commission is no longer needed to keep the party together. That said, some have been left disappointed by the Unity Commission’s shortcomings, specifically in its inability or unwillingness to seek a coalition with the nation’s more extreme leftist groups. Others also remain skeptical that the internal workings of the Democratic Alliance are as unified as they are putting themselves out to be. After all, Hodges was an outsider, the idea of her now being welcomed in by the establishment is a bit hard to grasp for many.

Legislative officials have all at least reached the agreement that the budget needs to be balanced so that the state has greater access to discretionary funds when they are needed. However, the few spending cutbacks that have already been approved are not projected to be enough to build the backup capital that the administration desires, and deepening these cuts any further would almost certainly prove deeply unpopular with the citizens of the Great Lakes Confederation. Therefore, in order to raise the funds the state is looking for, the legislature has come up with two roundabout options for raising additional funds. The first option is to implement some mild protectionist policies on our trade, helping us to earn more from any commerce with other countries, as well as adding toll roads to turn a profit off of anyone entering or exiting the country. The second option is to hide some small additional taxes on certain luxury goods and services disproportionately used by the rich, as the upper class always has more money to spend. Either of these options will likely frustrate conservatives in the country, but they should give us access to the money we need."

However, the more decentralized form of the Confederation has proven to be overwhelmingly popular with the people of the Great Lakes, as evidenced by the outcome of the referendum. In a move that defies the will of many within her party, President Hodges today announced that the date of the referendum will be forever commemorated as Confederation Day, a national holiday complete with parades and mandated days off of work. This move has, as expected, angered some of the old guard in the Democratic Alliance, although they have remained mostly quiet about their disagreements. This is because the public has already voiced a torrential downpour of support for the new holiday, which they have taken as a sign that the new administration really does care about maintaining their approval, even if it means running against party tradition."

However, his Libertarian party has not managed to attain a majority in the broader elections, and so they’ll need to create some sort of coalition with another party if they have any hopes of getting their agendas passed. Already the Democratic Alliance and the Republicans have begun offering conditional support to the Libertarians, hoping to secure elements of their own agendas with the help of President Ventura.

Going forward, President Ventura and the Libertarians have promised not to make too many moves in regards to weakening the welfare state, and have instead made it clear that their purpose is to encourage their beliefs of radical individualism through other economic and social policies. This turn of events has been disappointing to many Conservatives and orthodox Libertarians, as they had hoped that Ventura’s administration would finally be the one to cut back on taxation and social spending.

To many, this new coalition is a natural fit, as both parties are dedicated to economic individualism and the contraction of the Democratic Alliance’s bloated welfare state. That said, the platforms of the two parties tend to butt heads considerably in the realm of social issues, with the Libertarians preferring a more progressive stance than the highly conservative stance of the Republicans. With that in mind, this realm will almost certainly be one that necessitates compromise going forward if the coalition between the Libertarians and Republicans is to hold. This coalition has come as a disappointment to many Libertarian voters, who had voted for the Libertarians over the Republicans specifically for their social progressivism, although President Ventura has attempted to reassure them, stating that "Under no circumstances will we tolerate the institutionalization of bigotry into our government". Nevertheless, the people wait with bated breath to see what new changes the Libertarian party will manage to bring to the table."

The move, while applauded by liberals, who have begun further cooperation with Ventura's government on social progressive legislation, has attracted the ire of radicals in the party.\n\nMichael Badnarik, activist and exile from Indiana and one of the party's fiercest fiscal conservative stalwarts, has condemned Ventura's government as "socialistic", denying the core economic freedoms that all people of America deserve. With support from many other hardliners in the party such as Justin Amash, Badnarik's movement is gaining traction among our core base, but at least, for now, moderates and populists continue to support the Ventura government without question."

 greatlakes.154.d:0 "With the Republicans now forming a coalition with the Libertarians and helping them to execute the vision of President Jesse Ventura, the time has now come for the Libertarians to pay back the Republicans for their support. With the two mostly aligning on economic issues and the Libertarians refusing to compromise on most social issues, the list of things the Libertarians can do to keep the Republicans’ support is somewhat thin. After extensive deliberation, the administration today decided that the first concession shall be in the realm of immigration. It’s not an especially hot-button topic for the Libertarian voter base, although some do view strengthening border control to be an example of government overreach. Regardless, in order to maintain the current coalition, President Ventura has signed off on a bill to reform immigration, effectively closing the country’s borders to the vast majority of prospective immigrants and dramatically increasing the amount of personnel dedicated to enforcing the border. The Republicans have celebrated this legislative package as a victory for security of the Great Lakes, preventing the violence and crime that unverified immigrants allegedly welcome in."

If ever there was an ideology that stood antithetical to this fundamental belief, it would have to be Fascism. It is a putrid, abhorrent system, having caused nothing but suffering and misery and violence throughout history, and thus it is imperative that it be expunged from any polite society. The same must be said of the rabidly nationalistic militias that have organized throughout the country with their fetishistic dreams of overthrowing the current administration in favor of their own. Since coming into office President Ventura has wanted nothing more than to get rid of these wannabe dictators, and at last the opportunity to do so has presented itself. By linking these extremist groups to a number of organizations and attacks that have occurred throughout the Great Lakes and the former United States at large, they can be declared terrorist organizations, giving Ventura and his administration the freedom to raid their strongholds and prevent them from acting on their sick desires, regardless of how shaky these links may be. Some Libertarians have denounced this as an act of government overreach, but most have agreed that this decision is necessary to prevent violence and unrest in the country."

Much of this historic document has found its way into the constitution of the Great Lakes Confederation, although often with some degree of modification or omission. This has led to a great degree of gun control being instituted by the previous administrations of the Great Lakes. This goes against the very ideals of liberty that were instilled in the old documents that form the basis of the current government. The second amendment states in no uncertain terms that the right to bear arms shall not be infringed in any way. To that end, President Ventura announced earlier this week that all gun control laws have been repealed, allowing anyone to buy any firearm they so desire. Almost immediately this caused a massive uptick in the sale of guns in the country, as well as in the importation of firearms from our neighbors. The end result is that more people in the Great Lakes are armed than ever before and that the economy is experiencing a small boom due to the sudden increase in commerce. President Ventura has remarked at how "pleasantly surprised" he is to see the enthusiasm with which the populace has taken to utilizing this new lack of restraints."

In no situation is this more evident than in the treatment of Native Americans in the United States. For centuries the United States used and abused the indigenous populations of the land it occupied, and even after its collapse, the many states that have popped up in its stead - the Great Lakes included - have done next to nothing to atone for these mistakes. That ends today. President Jesse Ventura has just signed a series of treaties known as the Ojibwe Accords into law, which aim to rectify the historic injustices committed against Native Americans. The treaties include various programs to fight unemployment and poverty in Native American reservations, as well as to improve the quality of housing and healthcare, which have been notoriously poor throughout history. While some of the Libertarian base has seen this as a case of government overreach doing something that should have been left to the free market, most have agreed that helping to reduce the striking poverty of a historically oppressed people is a noble cause for anyone to undertake."

They have decried his economic and social positions as too moderate, claiming that everything should be left to the free market and that it is the government’s job to police against social immorality. Of course, were President Ventura to conform to these ideals he’d be just another one of the Republicans that he campaigned against. Finding a pro-Ventura voice among the corporate media conglomerates is an effectively impossible task, as they have become so overwhelmingly dedicated to the Republican party. Until now, President Ventura has remained silent on the topic, believing that it is not his place to speak out on the actions of private entities. However, the most recent slew of libel and defamation has proved too much, and Ventura has decided to publicly denounce the corporate media, declaring that "they want not what’s best for the country, but what’s best for their wallets," During this press release, Ventura also announced that he would be filing an official lawsuit against several of the most prominent offenders, although this part of the release raised a few eyebrows among Libertarian voters, who see this as a potential infringement on media rights."

 greatlakes.159.d:0 "The former United States has proved to be a tumultuous and unstable corner of the world, leading to many administrations adopting comprehensive and overbearing laws to ensure security and stability. The previous administrations of the Great Lakes have been no different, layering on an ungodly number of regulations regarding surveillance, political organization, and other such things, all in the name of "national security". The time has come to repeal these laws, according to President Ventura. There is no need to spy on the people, there is no need to prevent them from organizing how they see fit, there is no need to restrict their freedoms at all. These rules and regulations were oppressive when they were implemented, let alone so many years after the dust has settled on the collapse of the United States. To continue with these repressive programs is to conform to the global stereotype of the corrupt and oligarchic North American backwater. We will prove to the world and to our people that the Great Lakes Confederation is no backwater, and no longer will it permit the institutionalization of corruption and oligarchy."

When people are free to make money how they see fit, free to profit off of the sweat of their own brow, that is when they are free to be the masters of their own fate. This is the philosophy that has guided President Ventura’s administration, and it has clearly paid off. The economic landscape of the Great Lakes Confederation is dominated by small businesses, with few major corporations, and many of these small businesses have proved to be incredibly successful thanks to the "hands off" economic approach of the Libertarian party. Everyday new small businesses open, and established ones expand their employee base. Seldom do ventures fail, and unemployment is on a steadily declining course. While some of the more progressive minded Libertarians had hoped that Ventura’s administration would focus on the social status of ethnic, religious, and sexual minorities, most feel that the newfound economic freedoms of the country have evened out these social disparities. The lesson is clear; in the case of government intervention, less is usually more. "

For years, protests regarding the treatment of ethnic, religious, cultural, and sexual minorities have been commonplace in the Great Lakes, with each administration finding some way, whether intentional or not, to relegate them to secondary roles in society. With an official declaration of his support for these protestors, President Jesse Ventura has decided to prioritize social liberation as the cornerstone of Libertarian party politics. After all, how can a nation call itself free if it exploits and oppresses and marginalizes groups over factors inconsequential to a person’s character? Many of these protestors had once been strong advocates of the Democratic Alliance, however, following President Ventura’s announcement, many have shown their support for the Libertarian party. Already Ventura has promised a plethora of new laws to prevent discrimination on any ground, both on the part of the government and on the part of private business. Every citizen of the Great Lakes deserves to live free from harassment and mistreatment, and the Libertarian party has pledged to ensure that right is not infringed upon."

Following this development, it was revealed this morning that nearly every politician even tangentially connected to the tyrannical and corrupt Hortman administration has been arrested. With Habeas Corpus abolished, these former public officials will see no court date, and will instead be immediately imprisoned for their crimes against the people of the Great Lakes. While some view this as a violation of democratic principles, it is important to remember that these Hortmanites were the first to violate democracy by rigging the elections in their favor and subverting the will of the people to maintain their repugnant socialist regime. It remains to be seen what further punishment awaits these treasonous wretches, but the people of the Great Lakes can at last rest assured that their chances of returning to power have been utterly destroyed.

The time has come at last to look to the future, and, try as we might, the Great Lakes will certainly struggle to survive alone. The country needs recognition, allies, trade partners; all things that are difficult to come by when the government is run by coup-happy police officers or militias. This issue could be remedied by transitioning at last to civilian rule, and there is already a prime candidate lined up in the form of prominent Republican politician Paul Ryan. Throughout his career, Ryan has showcased traits and convictions consistent with the ideals of the current militia government, only with the sort of legitimacy that only a civilian leader can wield. Despite this, there are doubts that any administration other than the current one can be trusted to oversee the restoration of the traditional American way of life, and so there is an argument to be made to keep the militias in power, international legitimacy be damned."

Ryan has made a name for himself as part of the growing Libertarian wing of the Republican party, with a particular fixation on objectivism and economic individualism. With Scott Walker as his Vice President, President Ryan has already begun reaching out to foreign leaders to try and build a sense of normalcy and approachability, certainly a break from the tendencies of former presidents Clarke and Vanderboegh. As a civilian rather than a sheriff or militiaman, Ryan and his government are already doing better in the realm of foreign and domestic perceptions of legitimacy, at least in comparison to the past administrations. However, many remain worried that he is still beholden to the policies and ambitions of the various strongmen who preceded him. Only time will tell whether he is a mere militia puppet or a real leader with the drive to pursue the betterment of the country. One thing is for certain; the Great Lakes have come a long way since the days of the Hortman administration."

 greatlakes.165.d:0 "In his short time in the executive office, President Paul Ryan has made frequent use of the bully pulpit, seizing the opportunity to espouse the moral and practical benefits of free market capitalism, a somewhat controversial idea in a country that has only recently been rid of socialist governing. Invoking the story of Ayn Rand’s character John Galt, Ryan argued in his most recent public address that the single most important factor in improving society is heeding the suggestions of the accomplished and the innovative, that government is, more often than not, a bureaucratic, incompetent mess that can only serve to hamper technological and economic advancement. According to President Ryan, the free market is the perfect mechanism through which these interests can be pushed forward, as it will naturally reward the most brilliant of society’s minds, and those rewards will inevitably trickle down to everyone else. This idea, while not necessarily new to the ears of many in the Great Lakes, is a massive departure from past administrations, and, between the unpopular Hortman government and the strongman regimes that have plagued the nation as of late, many are willing to give Ryan’s beliefs a chance."

For that reason, President Paul Ryan has announced today that taxes will be dramatically reduced across the board in the Great Lakes. With so many taxes either cut or outright abolished, questions have been raised as to how the current administration intends on maintaining the state’s various expenses. After all, the Great Lakes is known for its impressive welfare state, which is almost entirely funded off of tax income. President Ryan has largely dismissed these concerns, assuring skeptics that everything has been well planned out, and that they need only worry about how they’re going to spend all the money that they’re saving thanks to the tax reductions."

Despite their common ancestor, these fragments of the Republican party have long been estranged from one another, sharing little other than a name and general ideology. Today, President Paul Ryan has attempted to bridge this gap by reaching out to President [USA.Getleader] and the rest of the Southeast’s Republican party. The two Republican parties, as might have been expected, proved to align with one another quite closely, and have pledged their support for one another’s continuing success. There has also been talk of unifying their party platforms to ensure a coherent, centralized party that can persist in and control both nations. For now this proposal has been left on the table to be returned to at another date, but it can be assured that a beautiful relationship is beginning to blossom between the Great Lakes Republican party and their Southern counterparts."

While Ryan, as a civilian leader, certainly carries more credibility and legitimacy than Vanderboegh or Clarke, there is still no hard evidence that his rule truly has the consent of the governed. To rectify this situation, the President recently called for a snap election to prove his status as an ally of democracy. The results of the election have proven what everyone knew all along; that the people adore President Ryan! Ryan and his party won an outstanding landslide victory in the election. Some keen eyed citizens have noticed that several counties seem to have issued more votes than they have citizens, and it certainly seems a bit hard to believe that voter turnout apparently edged north of ninety-percent in the election. Of course, these nay-sayers and conspiracy theorists are just a bunch of left-wing malcontents spreading misinformation to suit their agenda.

After all, the Great Lakes sports one of the continent’s most comprehensive welfare programs, and those programs don’t pay for themselves. With low taxes and high spending, something had to give at some point. To address this monetary issue, President Ryan announced today the passing of the End Handouts Act, which has privatized almost every aspect of the welfare state. From this point forward, individuals will be expected to pay for their own necessities, as things like healthcare and old age pensions will no longer just be handed to them for free. To further justify this decision, President Ryan claimed that "welfare allows the weak and the lazy to burden the strong, and in turn burden all of society." Nevertheless, many are disappointed to see their welfare benefits abolished at the drop of a hat, even if their income has been significantly increased by the near absence of taxation."

Fascists would see personal liberties abolished and the free market perverted by the demands of their totalitarian state, and thus they must be expunged from the operations of the state. These perfidious would-be dictators have made their homes in the very militias that put President Ryan in power, and so this purging may upset some of Ryan’s former allies, but it is a necessary action to ensure the enduring stability of [Root.Getname].

Rectifying the damage done by Socialism was no small feat, and the threat of its resurgence still remains, ever lurking in the shadows. In an attempt to cleanse the country of these radical malcontents, President Ryan today enacted a bill to ban socialist organizations from operating in [Root.Getname]. As the materials of Socialist and Communist organizations, Marxist literature has also been banned to prevent this wicked ideology from gaining any further traction in the country. Some have protested that this action infringes upon the right to free speech and association, however, the official position of the state is that anyone who adheres to a Socialist ideology cannot be a patriot, as they are assuredly either under the payroll of the Socialist regimes to our East or at minimum would support those regimes over our own in the case of war, and thus they are a critical threat to the safety of [Root.Getname].

That reason alone would make them worth banning, and that’s without taking into account the ways in which they infringe upon labor rights. After all, their operations make it so that business owners aren’t free to exercise their right to operate their businesses as they see fit, and when they go on strike, their refusal to let others enter the business to continue working and contributing to the economy violates the natural-born right to work that all people possess. For these reasons, President Paul Ryan announced today that labor unions are no longer legally permitted in [Root.Getname]. This has caused a small uproar among unionized workers, who see unionization as their only way to protect their rights to safety and fair payment. However, business owners across the country have come out in support of this reform, thanking the President for unshackling the free market and giving them the freedom to operate however they please.

Following a series of meetings between Vice President Walker and these independent congressmen, a surprising number of them seem to have moved towards alignment with the Republican party platform, much to the chagrin of their constituents. In turn, the Republican party has largely embraced these politicians as friends and allies, despite prior smear campaigns that they had run against them. There are, of course, rumors of bribery and extortion, but whispers such as these are simply par for the course in the countries occupying the former United States, and as such certainly needn’t be taken too seriously.

The direction of the DeVos government was laid clear in her inaugural address, where she placed emphasis on the restoration of freedom in the confederation after years of socialist control. The reactions politically have ranged between critical to near euphoric, with socialists generally negative, and conservatives generally positive.

This morning it was announced that Erik Prince and his private military company, Blackwater, will be granted a government contract to assist in military matters. The capacity of Blackwater’s involvement in the military has yet to be announced, but the decision has already raised questions of conflicting interests and accusations of nepotism. President DeVos has already done her best to assuage these fears, claiming that her brother’s company is simply the most experienced, cooperative, and forward thinking option that has yet been presented to her. While this has calmed the qualms of most Republicans, many others remain wary of potentially welcoming corruption into a country that has long struggled with it.

Even worse, many, such as Steve King, still advocate for the policies of the extreme Christian People’s Party. This childish infighting must be brought to heel, and the lunacy must be expunged from the party. As the party of government, the Republican party must now be held to a higher standard of professionalism, lest it be mistaken for a group of power hungry militiamen. President DeVos and Paul Ryan, with their hands forced, have begun cracking the whip, pressuring the various factions of the Republican parties into getting their acts together and actually cooperating to tear down the remaining vestiges of socialism in the Great Lakes.

Additionally, Betsy DeVos, Paul Ryan, and the rest of the Republican party has made major strides in sidelining Christian People’s Party leader Steve King and the Republicans sympathetic to his cause, further reducing the influence of the organization. This morning, King officially announced the dissolution of the party, a mere formality when considering the sharp decline in membership as of late.

This is not to say that King’s opponent was particularly well loved, no, the fact of the matter is that King’s name has become synonymous with extremism, chaos, and demagoguery. Where there were once considerable crowds who saw King as the savior of the nation, all that remains today is a group of radical core supporters, a group so small that they could scarcely populate a rally.

Additionally, the act has carried with it a bevy of smaller reforms to benefit private schools and charter schools throughout the nation. Many officials, primarily those outside of the Republican party, remain skeptical on this legislation, feeling that the money could be better spent on improving public schools, especially when considering studies that show the negligible performance improvement that moving to private school tends to have, as well as the relatively small number of families who actually elect to change to a private school.

Prominent changes include a massive reduction in unemployment benefits, a restriction on those who qualify for disability payments, and the abolition of universal healthcare, among other things. These changes have proven unpopular with many, who have grown accustomed to having certain social safety nets keeping them from disaster, but many more affluent citizens have praised this decision, as it will surely mean lower taxes for them, freeing them from the responsibility of taking care of the lazy and the under-achieving. Some of the more intensely free market members of the Republican party, such as Paul Ryan, have still referred to this process of dismantling the welfare state as "incomplete," claiming that it still leaves too many programs to burden the successful members of society with.

According to the Madame President, this will "lift the boulder off the back of business," encouraging them to expand and grow, providing superior products and employment opportunities to the citizens of [Root.Getname] in the process. The new budget also includes some additional subsidies for charter schools and a small increase in military spending. The latter aspect of the budget has proved somewhat controversial in the halls of government, as many in the Republican party had hoped for a more ambitious funding of the military. However, the budget has, by and large, been received quite favorably by the Republican party’s voter base. "

With a message of a truthful, staunch conservative movement that could end the defeats of moderate Republicans across the Great Lakes and fierce anti-socialism, King has secured the reigns of a minority government, with no faction having any interest in joining his coalition of the faithful.\n\nVice President Tim Walberg, a pastor from Illinois and Michigan, was one of the first to join the CPP, and is now tasked with the draconian undertaking of wrangling both the party and the opposition while King pursues a godly agenda as executive. Although King has declared his beliefs of prosperity gospel fiscal conservatism and hardline nationalist rhetoric those of the people, many have taken to the streets to protest his inauguration, declaring it a gateway for fascism."

The first believed that he would appoint more moderate officials in order to garner a wider support base, whereas the second believed that the most likely outcome is that King would appoint extreme individuals to cater to his niche but highly dedicated followers. The latter appears to have proven accurate, as it was announced today that Paul Nehlen has been appointed to President King’s cabinet. Nehlen has long held infamy for his blatantly racist and white supremacist rhetoric, and his appointment to office has drawn immediate controversy, even among King’s own officials, with Vice President Michele Bachmann in particular noting that she believes that the President is "making a dangerous mistake" in letting such obvious extremists into the government. However, many of the Christian People’s Party’s most dedicated voters have celebrated this powerful statement against the political establishment and the ruling class of the country.

Under this new legislation, the militias will be given greater autonomy and freedom to recruit and train new members without government intervention. Mike Vanderboegh, one of the most prominent leaders of the militia movement, has publicly thanked President King for this act, and has openly stated that he has come to see the leadership of Christian People’s Party as "the most important positive political development" that the country has yet witnessed. There has long been a degree of ideological cohesion between the Christian People’s Party and many of the militia organizations of the Great Lakes, although many militiamen had remained wary of any sort of electoral political movement. With the passing of the Leaf Act, this hesitancy may well be at an end, forming an alliance between President Steve King and many of the nation’s militias."

It is no surprise that the militia-friendly King has aligned himself with patriot freedom fighters in the People's Commonwealth, but to many in the Great Lakes, open evidence that King has supported organizations considered fascist is yet more evidence he is working against the nation's interests and supporting fascism at home.\n\nKing has denied the allegations that he actually sympathizes with the organization, saying that he "simply wanted to get an outlet into the minds of those fighting socialist tyranny" and that most of the common Western populace in the APC who sympathizes with said groups are 'patriots fighting for their ideals.'"

Regardless of to what extent she agrees with the party’s positions on morality, militarism, economics, immigration, and other issues, President King’s tendency to align himself with radical militia movements and neo-fascists is utter lunacy, and cannot be accepted by any party that wants to be taken seriously by the world at large. Bachmann has already gone through several meetings with party officials to discuss this change in policy, marketing it not as a movement towards moderation, but instead as one towards the kind of professionalism that any party needs to attain in the modern age if they wish to see their agendas passed. As one might expect, President King is less than thrilled by this development, privately expressing his frustrations with Bachmann stressing the limits of her powers, although he has yet to comment publicly."

While the Republican party is much more moderate in their Conservatism than the Christian People’s Party, the two have a common enemy in the leftists and liberals of the country, and share a number of fundamental views. As such, the talks that are currently underway are surrounding the potential of a coalition, with both sides making limited concessions in order to form a government that can actually get legislation passed. This will, much to President King’s chagrin, likely necessitate that the party distance itself from white nationalism and the militia movements. Already King has voiced his opposition to this coalition, believing that it will corrupt the "purity" of the movement and force the Christian People’s Party to "work alongside the very political establishment that it was created in opposition to." Nevertheless, if the coalition gains enough traction, there’s little that King can do to stop it."

President Steve King has been publicly vocal about his disappointment to lose so many of his "brilliantly dedicated and highly valued" officials, although he has acknowledged that their more extreme beliefs cannot be overlooked. This is, of course, merely his public reaction. Privately, King has been noted by many as appearing "distraught" and "bitter" due to the way that he and many of the other more extreme members of his party have been sidelined as of late.

Additionally, the manifesto outlines the party’s views on social issues, denouncing the "morally degenerative" practices of homosexuality, abortion, drug use, and other practices that are "blatantly sinful" based off of the words of the bible. Notably, this new manifesto seems to leave out any reference to the arguably white nationalistic rhetoric that President King utilized during his initial campaign. Regardless, if there were any doubts as to what plans the Christian People’s Party has for the Great Lakes, they should now to be suitably dispelled.

Each rally started with a fairly standard spiel about how these people played a critical role in bringing about this divine political revolution in the country. Later in the speeches, the Vice President extolled the many virtues of agrarian life and its dedication to traditional Capitalist economics. In converse, the President spoke to great lengths about the Socialistic corruption inherent to urban living. This particular line of monologue led to some somewhat controversial statements, something that is not exactly foreign to the Christian People's Party. In their criticism of urban living, members of the cabinet mocked the "chaotic diversity" of urban centers and their propensity to attract "unsavory" foreigners. As should be expected, these remarks drew a fresh round of criticism to the administration, fueling accusations of racism and bigotry that have surrounded the CPP since King's original campaign trail. The party has done its best to downplay these criticisms, and have accused critics of promoting slander and being too "close-minded" to consider opposing political platforms."

This afternoon, President [GRL.GetLeader] signed off on a bill that aims to drastically reduce the number of immigrants that cross the border into the Great Lakes. This legislation entails a drastic increase in military presence along the borders, as well as a new system of intensive background checks and a cap on the amount of immigrants legally allowed into the country. Additionally, new immigrants will be required to stay in the Great Lakes and show signs of cultural assimilation before they are granted full citizenship. Many have come forth and decried this move as overly nativistic and anti-democratic, as it draws a clear line in the sand between who is and isn’t truly a citizen of the Great Lakes and harms the free market by changing the balance of supply and demand for labor.

While Listecki grateful to the Christian People's Party for enacting the ban on abortion, nearly every other action that the current government has drawn the ire of the Archibishop, although he has not publicly voiced his frustrations until now.

This sacrilegious practice cannot continue. Today, after receiving support from a coalition of Christian People’s Party members and Republicans, Congress approved a bill that has ended any sort of state recognition of civil unions. Going forward, only religious marriages between a man and a woman will be recognized by the state, and only these unions will qualify for any sort of economic or political benefits. This has, naturally, drawn controversy, arguing that it’s unfair to force non-Christians to engage in Christian traditions and that barring homosexuals from an act that carries important benefits with it is blatant discrimination that no person should be subjected to. The President and the administration have simply dismissed these protests as an "atheistic attempt to infringe upon our sacred values," although this has done little to people’s frustrations."

His brand of political thought, often derogatorily referred to as "Freyism", came into prominence during his leadership in Minneapolis, and now, he hopes his image there can carry into a reversal of hardline progressivism within the party. In contrast to Frey lies Al Franken, a close friend of the late President Paul Wellstone and staunch supporter of his progressive and uncompromising vision of a better world. Franken carries much of the charisma and political charm of Frey, but with a certain Great Lakes appeal that the urban moderates cannot yet muster.

The Star Tribune reveal had caused protest numbers to swell, and as the day went by, it is estimated that the crowds doubled in size, tripling in some regions. It appears that by inciting a coup, King has given the rope by which the people intend to hang him."

Stating that the former Hortman government let thousands of east and west coast sympathising Communists into the state bureaucracy and the halls of power, it is imperative that something is done lest they undermine our country. Naturally, protests erupted immediately in response, as the Congressional Committee for Communist Activity already began its lengthy litigation of people suspected of having ties with the ‘foreign’ Communist parties, beginning the process with the IWW leader Angela Nicole Walker.

Under the leadership of [Root.GetLeader], the foreign policy direction has shifted distinctly in a more interventionist direction, as the Republican Party argues that only by fighting for democracy abroad can democracy at home be saved. The rhetoric appears to have struck a chord, as the policy of interventionism seems to be popular not just among the people, but seems to be influential within the other right wing parties as well. Both the Christian People’s Party and some sections of the Libertarians have endorsed the interventionist message, reducing the isolationist coalition to just the Democratic Alliance and a handful of left wing Libertarians.

This surge in patriotic sign-ups has been attributed to the success of the [Root.GetLeader] administration, which has seen great support in the approval ratings as of late, combined with the increased level of sabre rattling from the self-declared successor states.

[Root.GetLeader] clearly agreed, and had specified that the prune should specifically target the cities, supposedly the homes of most illegal voters. As bureaucrats went into action, countless residents of Milwaukee, Minneapolis and the many other cities of the Great Lakes received punitive fines from the government on the charge of fraudulently voting. The Democratic Alliance was furious, and urged people to challenge these blatantly unconstitutional fines in the courts. Their protests seem to have fallen on mostly deaf ears, however, as the President’s line has caught on with the people and in the media, and already, voters are cheering that the administration has stepped up to protect the democratic values of the Great Lakes.

With order restored, revolutionary leader Angela Nicole Walker was quick to call the newly controlled Socialist congress, now renamed the Great Lakes People’s Congress, into session. In the absence of a period of revolutionary terror, a few non-Socialist members of the former Congress have returned to their seats, though these represent only a marginal minority and are thus not expected to affect the proceedings of the People’s Congress.

Native rights activist Winona LaDuke has been an outspoken voice during this debate, advocating large-scale series of buybacks of territory in the reservations from non-native owners, as well as a series of grants intended to bolster the reservation economies. With this, she believes that the Native Americans of the Great Lakes may have a chance to stand upon their own legs. Opposite to her are a more radical faction of the IWW, who regard the reservations as yet another capitalist vestige to be done away with, instead advocating that the reservations be abolished and subsumed into the country at large, believing that the case of the natives can be improved only by total, legal equality."

As such, the question of the Democratic Alliance is becoming all the more pressing, as multiple figures within the People’s Congress are worried that they might undo the revolution.

While there were few in the People’s Congress who had any warm feelings towards the institution, and everyone agreed that the police could not be allowed to exist as it had, there was less agreement over what to do about it. Abolition is a popular stance, certainly, but at the same time, recent events have demonstrated to many the necessity for some form of law enforcement. As such, moderates are advocating a broad police reform, which would supplement current law enforcement with community organisations and make the police force significantly more accountable to the people. As a ‘middle ground’ between these two positions, multiple radicals in the People’s Congress have recognised the need for law enforcement, but consider the current police force to be unsalvageable.

Nevertheless, their outspoken support for the West Coast Communist administration has caused much consternation in Milwaukee, and although the blatant prohibition of the party was wrong, there are many who still don’t want to give the Communists more space than they need. Some are even advocating running active campaigns against the party, with the intent to showcase to the people the true nature of these Marxist-Leninists.

With the path cleared by her latest offensive against both east and west coast loyalists, it stands clear that her next target will be discord within the union. Meeting with a series of trusted comrades and leading figures, a program was drafted to which all party members now had to adhere, one that codified the Walker line with only few concessions given to the other factions.

This could not stand, and quickly, workers’ self defense units, supported by elements of the army, sprung into action, arresting countless cops all suspected of participation in this nefarious plot. Although certainly effective, and celebrated in certain sections of society, it has also introduced a significant gap in our law enforcement, as self-defense units and military police suddenly have to compensate for the missing police officers.

Drawing upon the legacy of the Black Panthers, the results of an armed and organised working class movement were obvious, and it seemed clear that these must be emulated. In a nationwide campaign, members of working class and minority communities have been encouraged to be trained in firearms and guerilla tactics, so that reactionary any invasion will be faced by an armed and prepared people’s militia. At the same time, armories are being established in both cities and rural regions, ready to ensure that the militias stand ready to wage a protracted war should the need arise. Although many leading IWW figures are supportive of this new campaign, worries that this measure will lead to a rise in vigilantism are widespread.

Meeting with farmhands and workers on the newly collectivised farms, the delegates stressed the need for the rural proletariat to organise, to ensure that their voices are heard as clearly as their urban comrades’. While many were appreciative that the large agro-industrial complexes that have been slowly buying up rural property were gone, the delegates were also met by numerous farmers who resent these ‘big city socialists’ coming out and lecturing them, with pro-King protests even popping up on occasion.

With the investigation continuing on with no holds barred, inquiries into the network of corruption within DeVos’ administration have revealed evidence against the President’s husband, Dick DeVos. Based on an impressive collection of leaked documents, phone recordings, and testimonials, it’s clear that Mr. DeVos has had an extensive role to play in the criminal theft of state funds; Erik Prince and Blackwater are hardly the only avenues of embezzlement lining the President’s pockets. The first gentleman now joins President Betsy DeVos and her brother Erik Prince on the congressional chopping block. Reportedly, the President believes that there is still hope that the many Republicans on the impeachment committee will vote against convicting the trio, even if the chance is slight."

The Democratic Alliance, who initially called for the investigation, have drafted articles of impeachment, looking to convict and remove President DeVos from office on the grounds of corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement. These articles are expected to be put to a vote within the next few days, and, considering the ample evidence against the President, her brother, and her husband, it’s hard to imagine a world where the outcome isn’t a decisively guilty verdict. However, DeVos still has support in the Republican party, who make up a majority of the impeachment committee. There is still a lingering chance that if the party whip is cracked fast enough and hard enough that DeVos might manage to stay in power. Obviously voting innocent on such an obviously guilty case may damage public relations, but it will prevent the Republicans from losing their mandate, at least for the time being."

In one last desperate attempt to cling to office, the President and her supporters set about enforcing the party line, pressuring Republican members of the impeachment committee to vote in favor of DeVos’ innocence. It seems that this last-ditch effort has paid off in spades, as President DeVos, her husband, and her brother have all been acquitted of all charges. The vote was close, and fell on almost entirely party lines. Every member of the Democratic Alliance voted in favor of conviction, while the majority of Republicans voted against it, with only a precious few Republicans defecting from the party line. President DeVos will retain her office, even if her approval ratings have hit rock bottom over the course of the trial. Current polls show the Republican party as a whole suffering greatly from the ordeal, with many voters claiming that they may not vote for them in the future. No matter, the party will just have to prove itself to the populace before the next election."

This afternoon, the impeachment committee moved to convict President Betsy DeVos, First Gentleman Dick DeVos, and defense contractor Erik Prince of corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement of state funds. All three have been officially stripped of all government positions and assets, and Vice President Scott Walker has been sworn in as the new President. The vote to convict was decisive, with every member of the Democratic Alliance and a significant portion of Republicans voting in favor of it. Much to the chagrin of those who had hoped to see DeVos and her associates jailed for their treasonous acts, one of President Walker’s first actions was to issue pardons to the three, putting the matter to rest for now. For now, the Republican party is battered and discredited, and it now lies on Walker to win back the support of the people in time for the next election."

Obviously, this action is highly suspicious, and seems to imply that these cabinet members are in on her corrupt schemes, and, as such, the impeachment committee has received authorization to pursue investigations into these purged cabinet members. The wealth of evidence against President DeVos was already impressive, however, these new investigations have already begun to unearth brand new leads to pursue. While it’s still too soon to say, the President’s desperate power grab may have very well opened the door to implications that would never have been made if the impeachment proceedings had simply proceeded as originally planned."

These investigations have quickly spiraled out of control, with new evidence and crimes coming to light seemingly with every passing hour. While the initial impeachment trial was conducted over the corrupt actions of President DeVos and her brother, Erik Prince, the new investigations have led to the inclusion of dozens of Republican officials, including Vice President Scott Walker, into the impeachment proceedings. It would seem that the administration has been hiding a systemic network of conflicts of interests. Every policy passed since DeVos’ ascension to the presidency has helped to line the pockets of Republican party officials, and it would appear that several have been taking bribes from other politicians, private companies, or, worst of all, foreign countries. The Democratic Alliance, who initiated this investigation or caught somewhere between disgust and excitement.

Today, the Democratic Alliance drafted articles of impeachment against not just Betsy DeVos and Erik Prince, but against Dick DeVos, Vice President Scott Walker, and dozens of other Republican officials and cabinet members. The evidence speaks for itself; these men and women have been using their positions in government to line their pockets, embezzling state funds and selling legislation or government secrets to the highest bidder. Nothing can stop what is surely coming any longer. And to think, if DeVos hadn’t reacted so drastically to the news of her impeachment these secrets may have stayed buried forever."

Secretary of Defense Jack Bergman stands alone as the highest ranking official to not be implicated in the horrific network of corruption, nepotism, and greed, and as such he is expected to be sworn in as president as soon as possible. However, with so much of the Republican party now removed from power and potentially facing prison time, Bergman will be hard pressed to assemble a decent cabinet for his new administration, and it’s doubtful that congress will allow him to do too much in his new position. Assuredly he will do whatever he can to rebuild the reputation of the Republican party, but the writing seems to be on the wall, and this scandal of unprecedented proportions will undoubtedly haunt the party for countless years to come."

Moreover, this new bill also encourages the formation of local, town hall assemblies to ensure that the average person has as much say in decision making as possible.

The government has initiated a Youth Awareness Campaign, reaching out to young activist groups in order to magnify their message, while serving to inform the older generations on the wants and aims of the younger ones.

With this, she has also issued a blanket pardon of anyone jailed for drug-related offenses, releasing scores of people jailed for such ‘victimless crimes’. The drug law was not a wholesale legalisation of narcotics, as the production and distribution of harder drugs such as heroin remains illegal. This law has not been passed without controversy, as many across the political spectrum have questioned whether this would be harmful towards the collective health of the nation, invoking the spectre of Opioid epidemics throughout history.

In the light of that, the Lindsay Administration’s decision to broaden the tent doesn’t come as a surprise, with the government inviting representatives from all Socialist parties to partake in the formation of a more proper popular front. Intending to allow the parties to resolve their differences with dialogue and compromise instead of the fierce fighting that have happened thus far. Publicly, the invited parties have all accepted the proposal, thanking the Lindsay administration for bringing them together, although some observers are wondering whether this will truly manage to bring an end to the factional struggles, or just move them into another arena.

[NEA.GetLeader] was reportedly happy that relations have thawed, and stated that ‘further integration between our two countries is only a welcome development’, a statement causing some measure of concern in Milwaukee given the People’s Commonwealth’s claims of being the legitimate successor to the United States.

As such, the thaw of relations that has been ongoing since the Lindsay government took power has instantly been reverted, with relations only being marginally better than before the revolution. [NEA.GetLeader] was reportedly disappointed with the decision, but did not appear too disappointed with the turn of events, simply stating that the ‘Great Lakes will hopefully come around soon enough’. The decision has been met with both applause and concern in Milwaukee, as many were worried that the young Socialist government would be ensnared in the economic orbit of the People’s Commonwealth, but with this, a decisive break has been made.

Support has been far from widespread, with impromptu demonstrations being organised by supporters of the disestablished reactionary parties, warning that the government is leading the country straight into the breakdown of meritocracy at their tamest, and that the government is trying to marginalise the white majority at their harshest. Law enforcement and army units have been on the case, but so far, the protests have continued without issue.

As such, more drastic measures have had to be invoked. In a grand speech to the Great Lakes People’s Congress, President Lindsay declared that Socialism in the Great Lakes had been corrupted, and that insidious forces have taken root within the Socialist Union. As such, the government will be undertaking a ‘New Revolution’ to root up these elements and allow for Socialism to blossom once more. Already, a broad reshuffle of the government is ongoing, to replace the loudest factionalists with more conciliatory voices.

If the People’s Commonwealth and the Great Lakes just stand together, then a brighter and more solidaric future would be possible.

As such, the Great Lakes Green Party, a smaller eco-socialist party, has officially been extended an invitation to join the Great Lakes People’s Congress to broaden the government spectrum and provide some sorely needed relief for President LaDuke. This has even seen some former members of the Democratic Alliance enter into the People’s Congress, as the Great Lakes Greens have seen like a safer alternative for the Democratic Socialists of the Great Lakes in such times.

Since assuming the presidential office, Prince has stepped down from his position as Chief Executive Officer of Blackwater to avoid a potential conflict of interest, but has remained on the company’s board of directors. The president’s connections to Blackwater have sparked a degree of mistrust on the part of the populace, and this has been made that much more prominent by this executive order. This move has also done little to curtail the rumors that Prince’s presidency was predicated on fulfilling the desires of corporate interests rather than any kind of actual desire to help the suffering people of the Great Lakes.

From this point forward, all Great Lakes citizens, regardless of personal faith, will be required to follow a code of laws directly inspired by the laws of the Bible. This move has drawn some backlash against the president, as the Great Lakes are a diverse region, with many different faiths represented in the country’s population.

Obviously this has led to the removal of communists and socialists from office, but even many social democrats and liberals have been removed from office due to their past collaborations with the Hortman administration. While there are some that view this as the most effective way to prevent division and the return of socialism in the country, many people view this move as an overly sensitive crackdown on the nation’s democratic institutions and freedom of speech at best and a desperate power grab at worst.

The creation of this congress is, in the eyes of much of the public, long overdue, having been something that President Erik Prince had promised to establish when he first assumed office. While not mentioned in any of the official announcements, there seems to be a fairly clear implication that this congress has been assembled in an effort to prevent the president from gaining any further power or passing any additional legislation without some degree of oversight.

Until now, congress has been merely an interim skeleton crew, and now the people will be able to vote in officials to fulfill the many open slots. Additionally, President Erik Prince has stepped down from his position in the face of insurmountable unpopularity and internal opposition, and so the general public will also have the opportunity to elect his replacement. These new elections have been organized by Vice President Ben Carson, who himself is running for the presidency on a campaign of limited government and restoring American capitalism to its former glory. There are other candidates, notably Eric Holcomb and Walter Mondale, but the polls have shown them to be lagging behind Carson to an effectively insurmountable degree. This has driven many to believe that Carson has used his position as vice president and organizer of the election to sway votes in his favor. However, outrage has remained minimal, as there is no publicly available proof of this conspiracy, and it’s hard to imagine Carson managing to be any worse than Prince."

Today, as one of his first acts as president, Holcomb has begun to follow through on this promise. Effective immediately, any public official who was appointed or supported by Holcomb and his cabal of corrupt kleptocrats has been officially expelled from their positions and banned from holding any other public office in the future. Many of these officials were not elected by the population, and were instead selected by Erik Prince and his allies when they overthrew the Great Lakes People’s Council, and so their removal gives the new administration the chance to showcase its commitment to multi-party democracy through the election process. Already several election campaigns are being organized so as to fill the void left by the many forced departures, and the public at large seems enthusiastic to once more hold democracy in their hands. Many in the American Democratic Republic had become jaded as a result of the corrupt and unpopular Prince administration, but this clear stance against the old era has renewed the populace’s faith in their government for the first time in a long time."

There is evidence that suggests that the government of former president Erik Prince allowed some of these extremists to take root in various organizations throughout the country, and, perhaps more troublingly, there are rumors that President Holcomb is in some way affiliated with them. These extremists spit in the face of democracy and pose a genuine threat to the American Democratic Republic and its citizens. This threat must be excised and these rumors quashed, and so, starting today, the White Phoenix and his followers have all been denoted as terrorists. Already dozens of followers of the White Phoenix have been detained from cells all over the countryside. Additionally, investigations have been launched throughout the halls of power to ensure that none of these potential insurgents have managed to weasel their way into government positions.

Many of these corporate figures flew in from Canada, although many were born and raised in the United States before its collapse, and so it’s quite possible that Carson’s outward intent to rebuild the pre-collapse American way of life has influenced their decisions on the basis of nostalgia alone.

In a speech intended to reinforce this perception, President Mondale further condemned the Prince regime, particularly for the mark it left on the nation’s democratic institutions. Apparently, several officials who worked under Prince have already approached the new President offering money or favors in exchange for getting their agendas approved. This is the standard that was set by the previous administration, and, thus, the standard that must be fought against. With the tone set, Mondale went on to criticize and condemn various other governmental functions that had been twisted and bent by Prince’s government. At the end of the speech, Mondale also announced a new code for removing corrupt officials from office for any future offenses, though critics have noted that he has done little to punish those already known to be corrupt.

In his speech on the topic, Mondale declared that the existing Bill of Rights from the United States constitution is inadequate in its ability to truly guarantee life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to its citizens. While it will take time to implement, this Second Bill of Rights guarantees all citizens of the American Democratic Republic the right to meaningful employment, fair wages, access to food and housing, healthcare, and education, as well as protections from the dangers of exploitative monopolies and oligopolies. Critics have referred to this revolutionary piece of legislation as "socialism in disguise," although Mondale has made great effort to clarify that the Second Bill of Rights exists in part to preserve capitalist social democracy from the extremism that disparity and suffering tend to breed."

Commencing today, administrative agencies will begin enforcing the de-collectivization and wide scale privatization of the region’s lands, businesses, and farms. Furthermore, special attention will be paid to the centralization of control in the region, as, prior to our annexation, the American People’s Commonwealth had ensured a high degree of autonomy for various localities.

"I am not Erik Prince," Holcomb stated in a public address this morning, "I have no intentions of twisting the institutions of this great country to fulfill my own selfish goals." His speech went on to further condemn any and all extremists, especially those who have led the American Democratic Republic and its constituent territories in the past. Closing off the speech, Holcomb declared that democracy is what made America a great nation in the first place, and that it is democracy that holds the only hope of reclaiming this lost greatness.

The IWW have a significant number of members within the Great Lakes region, and, as part of their quest to ensure the victory of the American People’s Commonwealth, they have organized several strikes and sabotages throughout the country. Additionally, the government has been thrown into disarray, as the IWW members that President Fletcher had formed a coalition with have announced their support for the American People’s Commonwealth, and thus refused to aid the Great Lakes Confederation in any capacity. The end result of this catastrophe is that, amidst an already difficult war, the industrial capacity and political legitimacy of the Great Lakes Confederation have been severely damaged.

Our military has already set about crushing any remaining resistance that the IWW radicals are putting up, and, starting today, any members of the IWW are banned from holding any political offices.

This reprehensible relic of a bygone age now lies a smoldering ruin under our occupation. It will take time to rebuild the region and even more time to establish a functioning democracy out of the ruins of the country’s systematically corrupt administrative apparatus. Obviously, all this work is a lot to burden our administration with, and so establishing an interim government would be much more efficient than maintaining direct occupation for the foreseeable future. To that end, congress has elected to place General Joseph Votel in charge of the interim government. Votel will oversee the reconstruction of the South and work to build a functioning democracy in the region. Some cynics have viewed this decision as a method of ensuring an enduring puppet republic in the South, but the fact of the matter is that this new regime in the South is fully intended to eventually become an independent and free democracy as soon as it is ready."

Additionally, our constituent territories would be recognized as no different than any other part of the [GRL.GetName], complete with all the regional autonomy and local government provisions that such an agreement entails. Overall, their offer is quite agreeable, and with the growing militancy of the world around us and the bloodthirsty ambitions of some of our neighbors, we may well do better together. However, our administration was elected to guide and protect our country, not to surrender it to our neighbors, and many feel that surrendering our sovereignty and joining the [GRL.GetName] is a violation of the oaths our officials made when they were sworn into office."

In the tumultuous world that we live in, having more allies is almost always a positive, but allying with any of the nations in the former United States presents a unique predicament. While the region has been a collection of disparate nations for decades now, the drive to reunite the fallen country still drives the emotions and ambitions of many leaders in the region. As such, an alliance with the [GRL.GetName] may risk drawing us into a war with one of the would-be successor states. Plus, if the United States were to be rebuilt by a friendly regime, they would certainly be a more useful ally than the [GRL.GetName]. Nonetheless, the prospect of American unification still seems like more of a pipe dream than a reality, and there are benefits to having a divided America.

There is, of course, the matter of the growing tensions in the world and Canada’s role in them, which could result in our being dragged into a new major conflict.

Admittedly, we were also somewhat counting on their protection from the aggression of our neighbors and their strange pipe dreams of reuniting the United States. According to the Canadian officials, it is these potential wars of aggression in our proverbial neighborhood that makes us a potential liability as an ally.

However, despite our close ties with the American People’s Commonwealth, not everyone in our administration is so ready to become one with them and sacrifice our national sovereignty. However, the government in Philadelphia isn’t too fond of having its desires rejected, and, based on their track record, it seems entirely possible that they would attack us if we refuse, even if our nations are close friends.

 GRL_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Founded on the shores of the Great Lakes in 1997, the Great Lakes Republic is a shining beacon in the post-American collapse, being relatively prosperous and politically stable, having been under rule by the broadly progressive Democratic Alliance since 2001. The Republic does not enjoy universal support, however, as many are still fondly remembering the Confederation that came before, particularly those on the right. At the same time, the Hortman administration has taken increasingly authoritarian measures, as left wing activists and right wing militias vie for influence."
