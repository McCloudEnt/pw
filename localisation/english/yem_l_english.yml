yemen.26.t: "Republic of Yemen Seeks Military Aid"
yemen.26.d: "With the outbreak of the Second Yemeni Civil War, ambassadors from the Al-Islah government have today reached out to our government in the hopes of, once again, receiving our support in this conflict. Having already supported the Yemeni government during the first civil war, with our intervention leading to their victory, there are many who believe we should accept their request and once again involve ourselves in the affairs of the Middle East, stating that our abandonment of the Al-Islah government would lead to the further destabilization of Arabia and risk the return of the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen. However, despite widespread support for our involvement, others have opposed our renewed intervention. Those opposed to our intervention have pointed to the fact that the initial intervention authorized by President Rumsfeld in 2002 led to the continued stagnation of our economy, due to the significant increase in military spending. With many not wishing to once again get involved in a conflict halfway across the world, President [USA.Getleader] must now decide how much the Al-Islah government's survival means to our republic and whether we can accept its loss after spending five years working to secure its survival."
yemen.26.o1: "We shall help our Middle Eastern allies"
yemen.26.o2: "We cannot risk repeating the mistakes of the past"
yemen.27.t: "American Republic Agrees to Send Military Aid"
yemen.27.d: "Much to the jubilation of our government, the American Republic has now promised to send military advisors to our nation in the hopes of overseeing our victory in the ongoing civil war. With these advisors, and auxiliary forces, having already landed at Hodeidah airport in the early hours of the morning our generals have now begun working closely with these new forces hoping to once again ensure our victory and solidify ourselves as a close ally of the legitimate American government. The acceptance of our request by the American government has relieved much of the pressure within the government, with President Qahtan believing that with American support the civil war will now come to an end much quicker than many were anticipating. With our front lines now adequately defended, our foes will soon be brought down and, in time, we shall once more reclaim our position as the one and only government of our nation, all thanks to the American Republic and its valiant soldiers."
yemen.27.o1: "We can always rely on our American allies!"
yemen.28.t: "American Republic Refuses to Send Military Aid"
yemen.28.d: "Much to the dismay of our government the American Republic has refused to send advisors to our nation, leaving us to fend for ourselves in a conflict that has continued to worsen with every passing day. With this news spreading across the thinly stretched front lines, our generals have now raised concerns about our prospects in this war with many believing that the only way we shall be victorious is if we are prepared for a long war of attrition. Whilst not ideal, with many fearing a repeat of the first civil war, the President has now authorized the army to take any means necessary to secure the survival of the republic. Now across the front lines our soldiers have begun to establish fortifications and engage, where possible, in trench warfare in the hopes of dwindling down the stockpiles and manpower of the various rebel factions. With this tactic proving to be a success, with shelling from artillery decreasing every day, the army has proven to all it is ready to stand until the last man to protect both the president and the republic in which he serves."
yemen.28.o1: "The republic must not fall! We shall win without America's aid"
yemen.30.t: "Republican Guard Disbanded"
yemen.30.d: "Even though Saleh and his lackeys have been brought to justice, his cult of rabid followers must never be allowed to regain prominence. Today, President Qahtan has announced that effective immediately the Republican Guard, which continues to retain loyalty to Saleh and his ideals, is to be disbanded and Saleh to be swiftly jailed without the chance for parole. Whilst many within the army have expressed their support for this decision, realising the potential it brings for further reform within the military, some have opposed this decision believing that loss of the Republican Guard will have an overall negative impact on the Yemeni armed forces. Whilst elements within the army may continue to protest this decision, President Qahtan believes that this supposed “purge” is the best course of action for Yemen and that without it “insidious clandestine elements still loyal to the traitor Saleh will continue to seek to usurp the legitimate government.” With Saleh now imprisoned, and his precious Republican Guard disbanded, Yemen is slowly being rebuilt and stability is being restored after the brutal civil war."
yemen.30.o1: "Saleh’s dogs will never threaten us again."
yemen.31.t: "Fate of the Jasmines"
yemen.31.d: "Following the capture of their main base of operations in Aden City, many of those still loyal to the Jasmine Council fled north with their leaders, Khaled Bahah, Tawakkol Karman and Najeeb al-Shaabi, reaching as far north as Ta'izz before their capture. Now after a lengthy trial, the court must determine not only their fates but the legality of the Jasmine movement itself. The vast majority in the government sees these three and their movement as nothing more than traitors and should be jailed and their party outlawed. However, there are elements within Al-Islah who instead believe that the Jasmines represented legitimate grievances among the Yemeni populace prior to the civil war and argue that they should be pardoned and allowed to run in future elections. While these voices are in the minority, it appears that public support is on their side and if the courts do not grant them amnesty then protests will likely occur. There are also those  among the population who feel that the Jasmines, having taken up arms against the legitimate Yemeni government, deserve whatever punishment the courts deem fit. With the courts having finally agreed the Jasmine Council is to be…"
yemen.31.o1: "Outlawed and their leaders jailed"
yemen.31.o2: "Granted political amnesty"
yemen.32.t: "Trial of the Southern Leadership"
yemen.32.d: "With the capture of Ali Salem al-Beidh and other leaders of the failed Southern movement, President Qahtan has today announced that justice shall be swiftly enacted upon the “treasonous Soviet puppets.” In a largely public trial, al-Beidh was today found guilty of sedition and treason with his fate yet to be determined by the courts many believe that his days are now numbered. After promising that a large portion of the Yemeni military will remain in the south for the foreseeable future to ensure that seditious activity cannot begin again, President Qahtan passed legislation amending the ban on the Communist Party. Now anyone suspected of having communist sympathies can be arrested and detained indefinitely. Similarly, any suspected party to have been associated with the southern uprising will also be banned and their leadership arrested. Thanks to this new legislation, it is unlikely that the remaining insurgents in the south will be able to garner enough public support to attempt to overthrow the government again."
yemen.32.o1: "With the stroke of a pen, their rebellion is at last at an end."
yemen.33.t: "National Convention Begins"
yemen.33.d: "Having promised to unite the nation after the horrific civil war, President Qahtan announced the beginning of the National Convention aimed at both solidifying Al-Islah’s rule over the nation and uniting Yemen around its policies. However, even though representatives from President Qahtan’s Al-Islah party largely dominate the assembly, other figures have been invited to represent various sections of Yemeni society such as notable Salafist cleric Abdul Majeed al-Zindani who seeks to protect Yemen from communism, capitalism and other degenerate Western ideals. Another figure, Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar of the Yemeni Tribal Council, espouses similar social policies with the main difference from Zindani being the goals of opening up the Yemeni economy to the world and, in particular, investors and corporations. Due to their relatively insignificant representation at the convention, President Qahtan remains convinced he shall maintain leadership over Yemen"
yemen.33.o1: "The future of Yemen shall be decided here."
yemen.34.t: "Role of the Tribes"
yemen.34.d: "The first matter up for discussion within the National Convention is the role of the tribes within Yemeni society. President Qahtan has insisted that the present relations held between the government and its various tribes is efficient and that any radical change would disrupt the balance that has survived in Yemen for years. However, opposition to this plan has been consistent within the convention with members of al-Zindani’s Salafi Movement denouncing the President's plan as a “betrayal to those who have been loyal for decades,” instead al-Zindani has demanded that tribes loyal to the government are to be compensated for their loyalty and elevated within society. Whilst there are some who agree with Zindani’s proposals, there have been none more opposed to Qahtan on the issue than Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar of the Tribal Council who argues that if Yemen is to be saved from turmoil it must hand over power to the tribes and allow for society to be ruled and guided by the people who know its lands the best. After much debate within the convention, the vote has now determined that…"
yemen.34.o1: "Al-Zindani convinces the convention"
yemen.34.o2: "The President's plan passes"
yemen.34.o3: "The Tribal Councils won the argument"
yemen.35.t: "Direction of the Economy"
yemen.35.d: "With the matter of the tribes settled, the convention has now begun the debate on the future of the Yemeni economy. President Qahtan has determined that the economy must be modernised, believing that without modernisation the nation will be doomed to remain a technological and economical backwater. To that end, he has proposed granting subsidies to various companies allowing them to expand and benefit the economy. Furthermore, the President aims to slash the national trade deficit by rebuilding the mining industry. Whilst most members of the convention agree with the President on this matter, there have been arguments over how economic modernisation is to be pursued. Al-Zindani argues that economic prosperity will only come through the doctrine of Islamic capitalism, allowing the economy to be guided by a centralised directive loyal to Allah. The Tribal Council feels that Qahtan’s plan does not go far enough, arguing that the Yemeni government and the nation’s corporations must be even more interconnected to benefit the economy. After much debate, the vote has shown that…"
yemen.35.o1: "Islamic capitalism will save Yemen"
yemen.35.o2: "The President's plan will save Yemen"
yemen.35.o3: "Only an alliance with corporations can save Yemen"
yemen.36.t: "Role of the Government"
yemen.36.d: "With most matters of the National Convention now settled, the only remaining matter of discussion is the role of the government in the new Yemen. President Qahtan has insisted that, once again, the status quo is an acceptable compromise and that the legitimacy of the government must be derived from the people of Yemen. Whilst there are some within his own party that doubt his words, the party remains loyal for the time being. Once again, the division has struck the convention with al-Zindani denouncing these plans believing it to be the continued rule of Al-Islah that led to the civil war and that only a new stronger President, one who has the mandate of Allah, will be able to save Yemen from further destruction. The tribal councils have presented a similar argument to Zindani. However, they have instead proposed that all governmental powers be handed over to the tribes who will then determine a new leader of Yemen through internal tribal elections. After much debate within the convention, it has been determined that…"
yemen.36.o1: "Zindani is right, Allah wills a stronger Yemen"
yemen.36.o2: "Any government must be legitimate"
yemen.36.o3: "The Tribes must lead the government"
yemen.37.t: "Al-Zindani Sworn In as President"
yemen.37.d: "In what many have viewed as a mere populist reaction by the most devoted Islamic members of Al-Islah and the Tribal Council, Abdul Majeed al-Zindani has been announced the victor of the National Convention and sworn in as the new President of Yemen. Despite former President Qahtan’s vocal opposition to Al-Zindani, he and his party have conceded their immediate opposition and stepped down as the nation's leading party. With this defeat, at their own convention, Al-Islah now resides as mere opposition to the Salafists and their policies. However, it is unlikely that any opposition will be able to have any effect on the new direction that Zindani will take the nation, given the Salafist Movement’s clear majority in parliament. Now with his victory, President Zindani is free to determine the future of Yemen in any way he sees fit starting with the radical alteration of Yemeni society to bring about a new Islamic golden age to the country."
yemen.37.o1: "Through Allah’s guidance Zindani will lead us to glory!"
yemen.38.t: "Mohammad Qahtan Maintains Presidency"
yemen.38.d: "Today, following the conclusion of the National Convention, Mohammad Qahtan and the ruling Al-Islah government have maintained their rule and the Presidency. Having initially called the convention to solidify the rule of Al-Islah, many within the convention were shocked to see the sudden and drastic rise of support for al-Zindani and the tribal council. Despite this drastic rise in support for an alternative, President Qahtan has managed to maintain his rule and legitimacy as the rightful ruler of Yemen and can now freely modernise Yemen and bring it into the modern era. However, even with Qahtan’s victory in the National Convention, there have been rumours circulating within Al-Islah that soon the President will face a leadership challenge both for his mishandling of the nation over the last decade and his lack of commitment to establishing a free and fair democracy in Yemen. Whether or not this leadership election shall be initiated is presently unknown, but such a challenge may spell drastic change for Yemen."
yemen.38.o1: "The status-quo is maintained"
yemen.39.t: "Government Powers Handed to Tribal Council"
yemen.39.d: "In what many have regarded as a nigh impossible feat, the government was today forced to resign in its entirety with all its existing powers being handed over to the Tribal Council. Immediately, parliament was then altered in its composition with the leading members of various tribes throughout Yemen being placed into positions of power. Whilst no official leader of the tribes has been elected, various representatives have stepped forward and insisted that soon elections shall be held to determine the rightful leader of the tribes and Yemen. This defeat for the Al-Islah government, at a convention called by them to ensure their dominance, has been viewed as a significant setback by former President Qahtan, who has begrudgingly accepted the outcome of the convention and like the rest of his party retired from politics following the collapse of the present Yemeni government. With the tribes now leading Yemen, it is only a matter of time before they begin to radically alter Yemen and bring about a new era of tribal dominance."
yemen.39.o1: "The Tribes will maintain tradition and bring Yemen into a new golden age!"
yemen.40.t: "No Clear Winner at National Convention"
yemen.40.d: "Despite weeks of internal debate and discussion over the future of Yemen, the results of the National Convention have come back with no clear majority. President Qahtan has maintained that with the majority already held by the Al-Islah government the National Convention should conclude with him continuing the Presidency. However, this has been challenged by the Salafi Movement and the Tribal Council who have demanded that the convention be extended for another week in order for a majority to be found. Even with this opposition, President Qahtan has refused to cooperate, insisting that Al-Islah has a majority within the hearts of the people. Yet despite this statement, he has ruled out calling elections to confirm this. The deadlock in the National Convention has confirmed the accusations of many and al-Zindani has accused the government of attempting to subvert the will of the Yemeni people and deny him the Presidency, with similar claims being made by the Tribal Council. Now only time will tell whether or not a majority can be found and stability returned to the national government."
yemen.40.o1: "When will this chaos end?"
yemen.41.t: "Al-Islah Reformists Initiate Leadership Challenge"
yemen.41.d: "Today the rumours that have been circulating within the party have turned out to be true, and reformist leader Abdullah Mohsen al-Akwa has now initiated a leadership challenge against the President. Citing reasons such as the disastrous handling of the nation over the past decade and, their more damning argument, that President Qahtan is opposed to democratic reform in Yemen and seeks to keep Al-Islah as the dominant political force through political violence and voter suppression. Having denied these allegations, the President has urged his cabinet and all members of Al-Islah within parliament to vote against this leadership challenge to allow for recovery in Yemen to begin sooner. Despite his demands for his parliamentary officials to toe the line and support the President, opposition to his leadership has continued to mount. Now after days of internal debate, the votes have all been counted with the results showing a slight majority in support of a leadership challenge. Against his advisor’s wishes, Qahtan has maintained he will run against al-Akwa and attempt to maintain the support of his party. Within the week another vote shall be held, where members of Al-Islah shall determine the future of not only their party but of Yemen itself."
yemen.41.o1: "More internal division is the last thing Yemen needs."
yemen.42.t: "Leadership Election"
yemen.42.d: "Today, one week after the initial leadership challenge, members of Al-Islah have gathered to cast their vote for either President Qahtan or his challenger Abdullah al-Akwa. Having accused President Qahtan of attempting to maintain Al-Islah’s political dominance through voter suppression and other authoritarian means, al-Akwa seeks to begin the reformation of the party and enshrine a legitimate democracy to Yemen. Despite the accusations by his opponent, President Qahtan has continued to demonstrate his support for democracy in Yemen, believing that instead of immediately granting free and fair elections to Yemen it must instead be granted time to heal from the scars of the civil war being guided forward by the party until the nation has fully recovered. Throughout the two debates held during the week, the two candidates did not differ on economic or social policy with it becoming ever clearer that this leadership election remains about the candidate's commitment to democracy. Now after these fierce debates, the ballots have been cast and now counted with the clear victor being…"
yemen.42.o1: "Mohammad Qahtan"
yemen.42.o2: "Abdullah al-Akwa"
yemen.43.t: "Al-Zindani Proclaims Himself President"
yemen.43.d: "With no clear majority in the National Convention, al-Zindani has today proclaimed himself the victor and the acting President of Yemen. In the early hours of the morning, he and several divisions of the military stormed parliament and had leading officials in Al-Islah arrested. Soon after a delegate of the Salafi Movement read a hand-written letter from President Qahtan, that announced the President's immediate resignation and support for al-Zindani as the new President of Yemen. Such a move has been denounced by the remaining members of Al-Islah and the Tribal Council, who have accused al-Zindani of hypocrisy and initiating the very coup he had accused former President Qahtan of attempting to begin. Despite their opposition, there remains very little Al-Islah and the Tribal Council can do to oppose Zindani due to his support from elements of the military and the supposedly legitimate note from former President Qahtan. Whether or not al-Zindani will be able to maintain his Presidency is unknown. However, for the time being, the internal division has been settled and President Zindani now leads the nation."
yemen.43.o1: "Yemen needs strong leadership for these difficult times!"
yemen.44.t: "Riots in the Streets"
yemen.44.d: "Following President Zindani’s ascension to the Presidency the public has risen up against their President, citing his rise to power as nothing more than a coup against a government that had a clearer mandate to rule. The protestors have demanded President Zindani’s immediate resignation from office, the immediate release of former President Qahtan and the reconvening of the National Convention to determine a legitimate leader. Despite these demands and the rise in the support for the protestors, President Zindani has refused to cooperate and has only tightened his grip on power by using these protests as an excuse to expand his executive power. Already the protests have become violent as protestors have begun burning police vehicles and targeting the homes of known Zindani officials. The protestors have made it clear that they shall not capitulate to the demands of President Zindani to return home and allow his legitimate government to rule unopposed. As the protests continue to build in support and the protestors methods become more extreme, President Zindani has now authorised the use of military force to quell the protests."
yemen.44.o1: "Send in the military!"
yemen.46.t: "Military Refuses to Cooperate"
yemen.46.d: "Despite having been ordered by President Zindani to crush the protest by any means necessary, including the execution of violent protestors, several leading figures within the military have today banded together and defied these orders calling their soldiers to merely stand by and allow the protests to occur. In response to this rebellion within the armed forces, President Zindani has ordered the remaining soldiers under his command to open fire upon citizens and their former comrades in arms. However, when giving the order none of those supposedly loyal to his cause agreed to the plan stating that with the present situation of the nation this may be exactly what is needed to reignite tensions and begin a third civil war. Soon after, most remaining generals resigned from their position being branded as enemies of the state. With the resignation of the vast majority of his military personnel, and public opinion rapidly turning against him, President Zindani’s time in office seems at its end."
yemen.46.o1: "The military is full of traitors!"
yemen.47.t: "President Zindani Removed from Office"
yemen.47.d: "At midday today President Zindani was removed from office following his attempted seizure of power. With the army having now placed the former President in jail, where he shall remain until his trial, the new military junta has now inaugurated Mahmoud al-Subaihi as the new President of Yemen. Despite the removal of one dictator, rioting has continued since Zindani’s arrest with the populace calling for the army to reconvene the National Convention and allow for a second vote on the future of Yemen. However, President Subaihi has dismissed these demands citing the failures of the National Convention as the main reason for Yemen’s instability. With no signs of the President relinquishing his power back to either Al-Islah or the Tribal Council, the military’s rule over the nation has now become absolute with the population continuing with the riots that had existed under al-Zindani. For now the President has maintained his intention to remain as the nation’s sole ruler, yet with mounting opposition to his rule unless drastic action is taken soon then the nation may soon descend once again into civil war."
yemen.47.o1: "President Subaihi has brought stability to Yemen."
yemen.49.t: "President Zindani Proclaims the Islamic State of Yemen"
yemen.49.d: "Today, in his first official act as President of Yemen, al-Zindani has announced the beginning of the reformation of Yemeni society as promised during the National Convention. Beginning his reform Zindani has stripped away references to the previous Al-Islah government, branding them as a “blight on Yemen’s history”. Furthermore, the office of President has now been abolished and has been replaced by the title of Emir. Such reform was taken further with Emir Zindani renouncing Yemen’s former name as the “Republic of Yemen'' replacing it with its new title as the “Islamic State of Yemen.” Now with plans to establish further societal reform, set to begin within the coming weeks, Emir Zindani has announced that Imam’s across the nation will be elevated from their current positions and granted more influence over the daily goings-on of Yemeni citizens, with the most senior of Imams being granted positions of power within the government. Such reform has been heralded as a success by most within the government who see the Emir’s reform as the beginning of a new age for Yemen."
yemen.49.o1: "Emir Zindani shall bring true reform to Yemen"
yemen.50.t: "Council of Imams Established"
yemen.50.d: "Following Emir Zindani’s elevation of the most loyal Imams throughout Yemen to high ranking positions within the government, the Emir has today announced that this reform shall be taken one step further with a new Council of Imams to be established effective immediately. With Imams from across the nation being recruited into its ranks, the Council shall seek to guide Yemeni society towards the Salafi Movement promoting its ideology and doctrine in local Mosques, through prayer, and in places of work. Run on a regional basis, each Imam shall be granted near complete control over newly established constituencies allowing them to promote the new Islamic way of life to their citizens more effectively. With a total of sixty constituencies, the new Council will, on orders by Emir Zindani, convene every month where each Imam shall give a detailed report of the advancement of the Salafi cause in their constituency, as well as be given the opportunity to request funding for the expansion of their constituencies economy. With the Council now beginning its first meeting, the Emir now tightens his grip over the nation with the Salafi Movement now reigned as the dominant political force."
yemen.50.o1: "Through the Councils will, Yemen shall be led to glory."
yemen.51.t: "Introduction of Military Loyalty Tests"
yemen.51.d: "Today Emir Zindani has announced the introduction of military loyalty tests for all new and existing members of the Yemeni Armed Forces. Aimed at determining the loyalty of the army to both Emir Zindani and the new Islamic doctrine, the tests shall begin immediately with scheduled training to be halted until all soldiers, including all field marshals and generals, have taken the tests and been marked by leading officials within the government and Council of Imams. With questions ranging from the army’s approval of the Emir, to whether or not immediate reform of the army is necessary the Emir hopes to reveal the shortcomings of the army and, if necessary, remove any disloyal elements from the army establishing a completely loyal army. However, despite the Emir’s intentions, complaints have emerged from senior members of the army who have stated that the phrasing of some questions are intentionally misleading in order to justify an attempted purge of the army. Yet the Emir has dismissed these claims, stating that if the army is truly loyal it shall know all the answers to these questions."
yemen.51.o1: "Let the testing begin."
yemen.52.t: "Military Testing Reveals Low Approval Levels"
yemen.52.d: "After a week since testing began, reports from high ranking government officials and the Council of Imams have reached the Emir’s ear regarding the results of the recently introduced military loyalty tests. To the surprise of all within the government the results have come back overwhelmingly negative, with over forty percent of testing revealing a lack of support for Emir Zindani’s policies and handling of the Yemeni Armed Forces. Whilst enraged at this lack of support for his government, the Emir has ensured his armed forces that he has begun preparation to look into the matters raised within the test results, going as far as to announce a meeting with the leading generals and field marshals of the army. During this meeting, Emir Zindani has made it known that their concerns shall be heard and if an agreement can be made then reform of the army will begin. However, elements within the high command have already refused to attend the meeting citing that such a meeting is a waste of time and that Zindani will never commit to true reform of the military so long as it weakens his influence over it. Despite these claims, the meeting has been set in stone and within the coming days the Emir shall meet with his generals to discuss the future of the Yemeni Armed Forces."
yemen.52.o1: "Reform is on the way."
yemen.53.t: "Emir Zindani Meets with Generals"
yemen.53.d: "As promised, the Emir has today met with his leading generals to discuss the matter of reforming the army. Having gathered with the rest of the Council of Imams, the Emir has suggested two solutions to the situation at hand. Whilst reform is the main agenda of the generals, the Emir has stated that only through the purge of disloyal elements can reform truly begin. Arguing that reforming the army will mean nothing so long as they are not loyal to the state and Islamic theory, and that this purge will only reinforce already loyal elements and encourage a boost in morale. The generals, whilst optimistic about Zindani’s commitment to reform of the army, dismissed the Emir’s proposal and demanded that reform begin immediately to ensure that loyalty can be restored without further backlash. With the meeting deadlocked, Emir Zindani then proposed a motion to the Council either begin reform immediately, or purge the disloyal elements and then pursue reform. Having allowed the generals to vote on the matter as well, it was determined that..."
yemen.53.o1: "A purge must come before reform"
yemen.53.o2: "Reform must commence immediately"
yemen.54.t: "Mass Arrests of Treacherous Generals"
yemen.54.d: "Following the Emir’s meeting with his generals and the subsequent vote on how best to proceed with the reform of the army, mass arrests have now begun throughout the nation aimed at routing out and purging disloyal elements of the military high command before true reform to the army can begin. Beginning almost immediately after the motion was carried, the generals in attendance were soon thereafter arrested and taken away to be placed on trial for their treachery. With over forty percent of the test results coming back as failures, the remaining loyalists have been tasked with hunting down and bringing their former allies to justice by any means necessary. Emir Zindani has already given the authorization for leading field marshals and generals who failed the military tests to be executed and made an example of. However, such a task has proved difficult for many within the army who have been unable to find those suspected of treachery, with the Emir believing that further disloyal elements within the army have been hiding them. With their search on going, the Emir has ordered for the execution of those already captured, reminding those and others of the fate that awaits traitors."
yemen.54.o1: "These traitors shall be found and executed."
yemen.55.t: "Army Refuses to Execute Generals"
yemen.55.d: "Despite orders from Emir Zindani himself to execute the treacherous generals and field marshals already captured in the initial purge against the military, word has today filled the streets that all generals captured were released with their executioners laying down their weapons. In a move that can only be described as treachery, the Emir has now ordered the purge to be furthered with all members of the military now being ordered to execute all those who refuse to cooperate with the Emir’s orders. Whether or not the order will be heard by the last remaining loyalists in the army is unknown, as following the release of the prisoners the Emir’s last remaining generals resigned from their positions and sided with their comrades in defying their Emir’s orders. With widespread mutiny in the army now common, the effects of this purge have now spread outside of the military with most citizens siding with the military. As Zindani’s support now dwindles, only time will tell if he is able to maintain his position as Emir or if he shall be overthrown."
yemen.55.o1: "Shoot them! The Emir commands it!"
yemen.56.t: "Rumours of a Military Plot"
yemen.56.d: "With increased rioting in the streets from both civilians and the military, rumours have begun circulating amongst the Council of Imams of the beginnings of a military plot to overthrow the Emir and have him replaced with leading military general Mahmoud al-Subaihi. In an effort to ensure that such a coup is not conducted, Zindani has ordered for the arrest and subsequent execution of al-Subaihi declaring him to be public enemy number one. Promising political amnesty for any individual or group who delivers al-Subaihi to him, the Emir has now become desperate to maintain his control over the nation, doubling his guard and enforcing mandatory nightly curfews. However, the Emirs authority continues to diminish as these curfews are frequently disobeyed with very little police presence left to enforce the new curfew. Now with Zindani’s authority resting on a mere rumour, many now await the day that Zindani will be removed from office and a new leader installed."
yemen.56.o1: "They wouldn’t dare."
yemen.57.t: "Emir Zindani Removed from Office"
yemen.57.d: "At midday today, the rumours of the military plot against Emir Zindani were proven to be correct as General Mahmoud al-Subaihi and several other generals marched towards the capital surrounded by loyal members of the armed forces opposed to Emir Zindani’s continued rule. After a brief tense standoff between Zindani loyalists outside the capitol building, with a firefight nearly erupting upon al-Subaihi’s arrival, the generals were soon allowed access into the building unopposed and guided to Zindani’s office who was caught attempting to flee the building through a hidden exit within his office. Having now been arrested and awaiting trial for his treachery against the armed forces, al-Subaihi was immediately sworn in as the new President of Yemen with the office of Emir being disbanded. With the removal of Zindani from office much of the population have now demanded that the President recall the National Convention and allow for democracy to be re-established. However, these demands have fallen on deaf ears with the President continuing to rule as the nation's sole authority. With the President’s refusal to reconvene the National Convention, the populace has continued its opposition to the President in the hopes of re-establishing democracy in Yemen."
yemen.57.o1: "Let them protest, nothing is changing."
yemen.58.t: "Reformation of the Army Begins"
yemen.58.d: "Following the free vote within the Council of Imams, it has been decided that reform of the army is to begin immediately with disloyal elements being pardoned of their failures in the tests and allowed to continue their service. However, despite this agreement that reform is to begin immediately, Emir Zindani has been presented with another challenge from his generals. Despite their victory in the initial vote the generals have now demanded that further reform begin to the military testing, demanding that questions relating to loyalty to the state and Islamic theory removed and replaced with relevant testing to the military's combat performance. However, despite their requests, Emir Zindani has refused to move on the matter and once again the meetings have become deadlocked with no sign of either side moving on this matter. Much like before, Emir Zindani has called for a vote within the Council of Imams to determine how best to proceed. However, the Emir has made it clear that all those who vote against the government's plan on this matter will be fired and replaced with loyal Imams. With the vote now counted it has become clear that…"
yemen.58.o1: "The tests remain as they are"
yemen.58.o2: "The tests will be reformed"
yemen.59.t: "Generals Protest Results"
yemen.59.d: "With the results of the vote now revealed and the generals having failed to push forth meaningful reform to the military tests, talks between Emir Zindani and his generals have now collapsed with there being no sign of reconciliation between the two groups. With the generals having left in a fit of rage, immediately resigning from their posts, the army has been dealt a significant blow to its loyalty to the state. Now prominent figures within the military have begun a campaign against their Emir, demanding that reform be brought to the military. Likewise, much of the civilian population has also risen up in protest against the Emir’s handling of the army and early reforms to society. With growing unrest amongst the population many believe that soon the calls for reform to the army may stem into calls for the resignation of Zindani. However, for the time being, the Emir continues to hold power in the nation and exert his authority with all it taking to change this being a single spark."
yemen.59.o1: "The people would never dream of removing their beloved Emir"
yemen.60.t: "Military Testing Reformed"
yemen.60.d: "With the vote having now been totaled and the generals having gotten their way, with multiple members of the Council of Imams now being forced to resign, Emir Zindani has agreed to begin reformation of the military tests. Instead of focusing on individual soldiers' loyalty to the state and Islamic theory, the tests shall instead focus on their combat performance and how best to use different tactics during different combat situations. With a new beginning for the Yemeni military on the horizon it is clear that the Emir is not pleased with the outcome of the meetings with his generals. However, it is clear that already there have been some benefits to the reform with serious shortcomings within the army being found and already rectified. Despite the Emir’s distaste for the current reform to the military, even he has privately agreed that the removal of the Yemeni Armed Forces is a blessing for the nation and all of Allah’s faithful. Now with the matters of reform successful, Emir Zindani has stated his intent to hold a speech before his newly loyal military thanking them for their service and dedication to Yemen."

yemen.62.t: "Emir Zindani’s Speech"
yemen.62.d: "With the reforms to the military now complete, Emir Zindani has today held a speech in front of thousands of now loyal members of the Yemeni Armed Forces. Beginning his speech by thanking them for their continued service to the new Islamic State, the Emir then began to move onto matters concerning the future of Yemen stating that in time “Yemen will be made into a glorious Islamic paradise built in the image and word of Allah.” His speech was met with thunderous roars of applause and cheer as he continued mentioning how soon Yemen will become the dominant power in the Middle East thanks to the guiding sword of Allah. Finishing his speech Zindani promised that so long as the army remains faithful to the Islamic way of life, Yemen shall prosper, its people shall prosper and Allah shall smile upon the Yemeni nation. Concluding his speech the Emir once again thanked those in attendance for their service, and as he left was once again received a wave of thunderous applause and cheers from his beloved army."
yemen.62.o1: "At last, the military supports the Emir."
yemen.63.t: "Meeting with Loyal Tribes"
yemen.63.d: "As promised during the National Convention’s debate on the future role of the tribes within Yemeni society, Emir Zindani has today called for the loyal tribal leaders to today convene in Sana’a to discuss their present status in society and their elevation in it. Promising to extend their influence, the Emir has offered to make both monetary concessions to the tribes and allow for the absorption of weaker, less impactful, tribes into larger tribes who had proven their worth throughout the civil war and Yemeni history. Whilst these plans were made without the consultation of the weaker tribes, the Emir has assured them that such unification of the tribes, despite their cultural differences, will benefit not only them but all of Yemen. With this merger it will no doubt take time for the tribes to accept their new position within society, and should they return and ask for further concessions it is likely that their wishes will be granted for the Emir remains a staunch ally of the most loyal tribes within Yemen’s borders."
yemen.63.o1: "Let it be known the Emir is a man of his word"
yemen.64.t: "Emir Zindani Unveils Al-Imam University Expansion"
yemen.64.d: "Originally established in 1993 by Emir Zindani, the Al-Imam university has been home to thousands of Islamic scholars since its establishment all dedicated to learning the truth of the Quran and receiving the blessing of Allah. Now as the new Emir of Yemen, Zindani has today announced the expansion of his university aiming to make it more accessible for the male population allowing for even the poorest of citizens to be able to attend and become Islamic scholars. Having granted significant government subsidies to the university, Emir Zindani has today expanded not only the entry requirements for the university but allowed for the expansion of the existing university allowing for its budget to be spent on new classrooms and Qurans. The lowering of entry requirements and increased funding has already proven to be beneficial to the university with an additional five hundred students signing up for next year's courses. Emir Zindani has made a personal tour of his university, praising its leadership and wishing them well in their efforts to guide Yemen’s men towards the light of Islam and create a new generation of Islamic theorists"
yemen.64.o1: "A new generation of theorists awaits Yemen."
yemen.65.t: "Enshrining Sharia Law"
yemen.65.d: "Despite the introduction of the new Yemeni constitution in 2004 that introduced elements of Sharia Law into society, the Emir has today determined that the constitution did not go far enough at enshrining Sharia into the everyday lives of Yemeni citizens. Today the Emir has sought to correct such a matter, introducing the first amendment to the Yemeni constitution since its introduction. Now rather than Sharia Law only being partly, and loosely, enforced its laws shall be enshrined into the daily lives of every citizen within Yemen's borders. With this change the Emir has been assured that no longer shall the women of Yemen be free to live in sin and ignore the wishes of both Allah and their patriarchal figure within the household. Furthermore, the Emir has demanded that Islamic courts be established replacing the present courts system to further expand the influence of Islamic doctrine on society. As such, criminals shall be punished as Allah sees fit not as man does. Such a change to Yemeni law, and it’s constitution, has now brought Yemen one step closer to fulfilling the wishes of the Emir and making Yemen an Islamic paradise."
yemen.65.o1: "Allah smiles on Yemen this day!"
yemen.66.t: "Denouncing Arabian Communism"
yemen.66.d: "In a speech outside the capital in Sana’a, Emir Zindani has today denounced Arabian Communism in whatever form it may take. Having stated that “Communism and Islam are two incompatible ideas, with communism being used to subvert the will of Allah” the Emir then soon denounced all Arabian communist states announcing an official embargo of all left-leaning governments on the Arabian peninsula. Furthermore, the Emir has now introduced new legislation expanding upon the newly established Islamic courts to include punishment for communists and other socialists. Such punishment shall include the execution of all those deemed to be preaching against the word of Allah and the Emir, with over two hundred leading communist officials having already been executed for their crimes against the state. Emir Zindani has stated that once this internal purge has been completed, Yemen shall be rid of its internal enemies and on its way to at last become the Islamic paradise Zindani had promised it would become at the National Convention."
yemen.66.o1: "No good Muslim is a communist!"
yemen.67.t: "Emir Zindani Addresses the Nation"
yemen.67.d: "Emir Zindani has today addressed the nation to discuss its present situation and the future that awaits the new Islamic State. Having gathered a crowd of nearly five thousand, the Emir began his speech in prayer to Allah thanking him for the opportunity to rule Yemen and carry out his wishes. After finishing his prayer, the Emir then turned and thanked all for attending stating that “due to the hard work and dedication of every true muslim, Yemen has at last become an Islamic paradise modelled after the vision of Allah. Yemen is Allah’s chosen nation!” After thunderous applause from those in attendance, the Emir then began to speak on how despite the initial reforms Yemen has much to overcome and only together can muslims of Yemen, and the Arab peninsula, shake off the influence of the decadent west. Concluding his speech, Emir Zindani stated that the rebirth of Yemen has now been completed and that everyday from now is a blessing from Allah himself."
yemen.67.o1: "Yemen is Allah’s chosen nation!"
yemen.68.t: "Election Results Reveal Al-Islah Dominance"
yemen.68.d: "With the re-election of Mohammad Qahtan as leader of Al-Islah the President has now called for a snap election to confirm the people’s support for the Al-Islah government, and to increase the party’s already large majority. With the election now over it has become clear that Al-Islah has once again achieved a super majority demonstrating the people’s support for the President and his policies. With Abdullah Mohsen al-Akwa and his reformists being expelled from the party following their accusations of slander that the President had wished to use voter suppression to maintain their majority, the party is now unified around President Qahtan and his policies. Despite his ban from Al-Islah party politics, al-Akwa has continued to protest against his government by demonstrating the obvious fraud that occurred throughout the most recent election. Pointing to fraud such as armed guards at polling stations, turning away known leftist associates and the larger font for Al-Islah on polling cards. However, the government has dismissed these claims as the rantings of a man livid at his expulsion. With Al-Islah having achieved over eight-nine per cent of the vote, the President is now ecstatic with the support his people have given him to carry out their manifesto."

yemen.69.t: "Parliament Passes Articles of Reformation"
yemen.69.d: "In a historic vote, parliament has today passed legislation that has brought significant reform to the outdated Yemeni constitution. The legislation, aptly named the Articles of Reformation, brings much needed reform such as the influence of Sharia law being rolled back as to promote a more fair and just society. This reform has now granted women the opportunity to vote freely without the necessary patriarchal figure attending them during the process. In order to preserve the democratic institution, the Articles have now placed a ban on army presence throughout elections and referendums. The President has promised that this is only the beginning of political reform in Yemen, promising that Yemen will once again return to elections every four years once further legislation has been introduced to parliament and passed within the coming weeks. However, despite the lack of an immediate election the people are satisfied with the passing of this initial reform believing it to be a new era for Yemen and a new dawn for democracy."
yemen.69.o1: "Yemen is on the way back to democracy!"
yemen.70.t: "Ban on Opposition Parties Lifted"
yemen.70.d: "Following on the promise of further political reform, parliament has today convened and has successfully passed an amendment to the Articles of Reformation. With the initial legislation focusing on alteration to the Yemeni constitution and changes to voting rights, this amendment has today brought further reform bringing the legalisation of all previous banned political parties within Yemen, provided they pose no threat to Yemeni democracy. Along with this reform the President has also called for an election to be held in one years time, to allow for newly established and existing parties to regain their strength and organise their movements in time for a general election. Initial polling has already placed Al-Islah receiving fifty-five percent of the vote with the rest of the vote being split amongst newly legalised opposition parties. With this amendment, the President has stated that Yemen is once more a democracy and as long as Al-Islah exists it shall commit itself to the preservation of democracy in Yemen."
yemen.70.o1: "Yemen is once more a democracy."
yemen.71.t: "Outlawing the Salafist Movement"
yemen.71.d: "President [Yem.Getleader] has today announced new legislation outlawing the Salafist Movement and has called for the arrest of its leader, Abdul al-Zindani. Whilst al-Zindani has protested this ban, stating that he represents the true will of all Muslims in Yemen both parliament and the President have denounced Zindani as a tyrant bent on the destruction of Yemeni society. With the banning of his party, several of its leading figures have fled to Saudi Arabia where they shall continue to promote their dangerous ideals. With a warrant out for his arrest, al-Zindani was soon caught attempting to flee to Saudi Arabia along with several of his closest allies. Having now been apprehended Zindani awaits trial, where he shall most likely be found guilty for attempting to undermine Yemen’s democracy. With the Salafists now banned, the President has announced that “Yemen is at last free of all internal threats who would oppose its continued existence and democratic framework” Whilst ardent supporters of Zindani who refused to leave the country have protested the ban, the President maintains the belief that in time they will see the necessity for such action."
yemen.71.o1: "No longer shall Zindani attempt to destroy what we have built."
yemen.72.t: "President Addresses the Nation"
yemen.72.d: "In a press conference today held in the capital, the President today addressed the nation in a speech that has brought hope to many and significantly raised support for the Al-Islah government. Beginning his speech by bringing attention to the rapid reform that Al-Islah has brought to the country since its victory in the National Convention, President [Yem.Getleader] continued his speech stating that he believes in the future of Yemen and so long as “the people have faith in him and their government then Yemen shall prosper.” Continuing his speech the President urged the nation to be patient as further reforms are now being drafted by the government to ensure the security and prosperity of Yemen. With these reforms scheduled for parliament in the next coming months, the President ended his speech stating that “the future of Yemen, at last, looks prosperous.” With the announcement of new reforms scheduled for parliament, the President has now seen a rise in popularity with new polling revealing a rise of seven percent in support of the President."
yemen.72.o1: "There is a future for Yemen!"
yemen.73.t: "Public Support Reaches New Heights"
yemen.73.d: "Recent polling has revealed that, compared to the late 2000’s, the Yemeni population is once more proud to be part of their community with over eighty percent stating that they are proud to be citizens of Yemen. Furthermore, polling has also revealed that due to the new reforms enacted by the government millions of citizens have also demonstrated their support for the ruling party with over thirty-thousand respondents announcing their intention to join the party and support it in its continued endeavours. With the government receiving this substantial increase in support, the President has thanked the people of the nation for having faith in the government in their reforms since the civil war. The government has also announced that, with this clear support from the people, further reforms will be brought to the nation to solidify the new prosperity that it has brought to the millions of people within the Yemeni borders."
yemen.73.o1: "The people finally have a nation to be proud of."
yemen.74.t: "Tribal Council Elects Sadiq Al-Ahmar"
yemen.74.d: "Following the resignation of former President Qahtan’s government the Tribal Council has, until now, temporarily acted as the new government. For the past few weeks, the Tribal Council has been in control of all government bodies, passing through legislation and beginning the transition for a tribal-dominated society. Today, the Council has passed legislation that has now effectively ended their absolute rule of Yemen. In response to this legislation, the Tribal Council triggered an emergency session of the Council where its leading sheikhs were called to vote on who should succeed the Council as the official representative of Yemen. After much debate, the various Sheikhs of Yemen have now placed their faith in Sadiq Al-Ahmar, a descendant of the Hashid tribes. With his election, the new Sheikh of Yemen has promised to continue on the initial promises of the Tribal Council at the National Convention seeking to reform Yemen into a paradise for both its tribes and global corporations."
yemen.74.o1: "Sheikh al-Ahmar will lead us to glory."
yemen.75.t: "Meeting with the Tribal Leaders."
yemen.75.d: "Today the new Sheikh of Yemen, Sadiq al-Ahmar, has called for a meeting with Yemen’s leading tribal officials. Having stated that the meeting will seek to expand upon the initial legislation passed by the Tribal Council, bringing much more of the nation under tribal control, Sheikh al-Ahmar now begins the transition of Yemeni society towards one dominated by he and his fellow tribesmen. With the leading members of all major Yemeni tribes present the Sheikh began the meeting by announcing an immediate reform to land distribution, promising that under his rule the borders of existing tribes will be expanded allowing for the establishment of a truly fair system that will better represent tribal borders and cultures. The announcement of such a plan was met with immediate support from all attending tribal leaders, who in an overwhelming majority soon passed the new legislation soon thereafter. With the beginning of this reform to Yemeni society, the tribes have already become the dominant force in Yemen with Sheikh Al-Ahmar announcing that further reform is already being drafted."
yemen.75.o1: "A very productive meeting indeed."
yemen.76.t: "Purging the Remaining Salafists"
yemen.76.d: "In a surprising move, Sheikh Al-Ahmar has today announced a warrant for the arrest of leading officials within the Salafist Movement, demanding that they be arrested and face trial for crimes against the tribes of Yemen. Citing al-Zindani’s calls for the elevation of loyal tribes during the National Convention as the reason for his arrest, accusing him of treason against tribes who had chosen to remain neutral in the civil war, Zindani and other leading officials were soon arrested following police raids across the country. With the collapse of the Salafist Movement's leadership, the party has descended into disarray with no official successor to al-Zindani announced. In response to this, Sheikh Al-Ahmar has offered the remaining members of the Salafist Movement amnesty for the crimes of their leader in return for the movements absorption into the tribal movement. Such an alliance would cement the rule of the tribal movement over Yemen with the Salafists effectively operating as the tribes paramilitary ensuring protection for the Sheikh. With no other options, the Salafists now opted to join the Sheikh and aid in the preservation of Yemeni society."
yemen.76.o1: "The Salafists will become the sword, and lapdogs, of the Sheikh."
yemen.77.t: "Meeting with the Corporations"
yemen.77.d: "Following on from previous meetings held with the tribes of Yemen, Sheikh Al-Ahmar has today begun talks with the various corporations stationed in Yemen in the hopes of establishing a tribal-corporate alliance. With the meeting having taken place at Sheikh Al-Ahmar’s residency in Sana’a, various corporations were invited to discuss the future of the Yemeni economy and how businesses and tribes may work side by side to promote a new industrialised Yemeni economy. Having promised the corporations unfettered access to Yemen’s untapped resources, Sheikh Al-Ahmar, in turn, requested that as payment for access the corporations begin to establish themselves across Yemen. Despite the vast sums of money that the corporations will initially lose establishing new offices and industrial sites the corporations were quick to agree having seen the benefits of the agreement. Now, with the promise of access to a percentage of Yemen’s yet unfound resources, millions of rials are being invested into the economy with millions more soon to come from the benefits of the tribal-corporate alliance."
yemen.77.o1: "The tribal-corporate alliance will revitalise our economy."
yemen.78.t: "Increased Support from Multinational Corporations"
yemen.78.d: "Following the initial meetings with the corporations already stationed in Yemen, word has now spread amongst the international capitalists community with several leading businesses from nations across the world now asking for residency in Yemen. With companies from both the consumer goods and military sectors requesting access to Yemen, the Sheikhs corporate alliance has proven itself beneficial to the Yemeni economy. However, whilst these corporations are requesting to establish new factories and industries in Yemen they have stated their intentions of only establishing themselves in already developed regions, especially Sana’a, in order to maximise their profits. This agreement has raised concerns about the future of Yemeni industry, with many living outside of cities fearing that continued development in this manner will lead to the abandonment of the countryside and traditional agricultural lifestyle. Despite these concerns, the Sheikh has ensured that development in these regions will not be abandoned and all of Yemen will continue to prosper under the new tribal-corporate alliance."
yemen.78.o1: "All multinationals are welcome in Yemen."
yemen.79.t: "Sheikh Al-Ahmar Meets with Al-Houthi"
yemen.79.d: "Today, in a historic meeting, Sheikh Al-Ahmar has met with Houthi leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi to discuss the potential for an alliance between leading tribes and the Houthi movement. Having met in Sana’a to discuss the potential for the alliance, Sheikh Al-Ahmar opened negotiations by stating that any potential alliance between the Houthi movement and the leading tribal government must include the Houthis integration into the tribal movement with the organisation acting to instruct and aid the Yemeni armed forces. Whilst initially hesitant to having the Houthi movement become another section of the military, with al-Houthi refusing to become a second Salafist movement, the Sheikh was quick to promise the Houthi movement positions within the government preventing them from being sidelined or denied proper representation. With the alliance now secured the Houthi tribes have immediately upheld their end of the deal, beginning to reform and develop the military."
yemen.79.o1: "We welcome our Houthi friends into the tribal alliance."
yemen.80.t: "Corporations Agree to Takeover of Industry"
yemen.80.d: "Corporations have today agreed, following three weeks of tense negotiations, to withdraw their internally hired chief executive officers from Yemen and in turn hire prominent sheikhs in their place. This agreement, which makes the most prominent sheikhs in Yemen the new CEO’s of companies stationed in Yemen, has now solidified the tribal corporate alliance after many critics feared it would force corporations to pull out of Yemen. Despite these fears Sheikh Al-Ahmar was able to secure an agreement that allows the corporations to maintain their majority share in their companies despite the new leadership. With the sheikhs now leading the corporations stationed in Yemen, initial reports have stated an increase in factory output with factories radically altering the manufacturing process to benefit its workers lowering working hours and slightly increasing wages. With this takeover the economy has seen a recent uptick with many leading Yemeni economists believing it will continue to rise. Sheikh Al-Ahmar, soon after this announcement, took credit for the economic upturn stating that without the tribes Yemen would have remained an economic backwater."
yemen.80.o1: "The sheikhs shall lead our corporations into the future."
yemen.81.t: "Sheikhs Granted Further Control over Yemeni Society"
yemen.81.d: "Sheikh Al-Ahmar has today passed legislation that has greatly reorganised Yemeni society, aiming to finally establish a society dominated by he and his fellow sheikhs. Under the newly passed legislation, matters once assumed to be better handled by experts in their field have now been replaced with sheikhs loyal to Al-Ahmar. Under the new legislation, Sheikh Al-Ahmar aims to continue the tribalisation of Yemen forcing through the radical restructuring of society to conform to the norms of the various tribes in Yemen. The passing of this legislation has now begun the alteration of society, with professions such as teachers being replaced with sheikhs, who are to educate the youth of tribal structure and traditions. Leading scientists and farmers have also been replaced with sheikh loyalists where, much like sheikhs appointed as teachers, they shall aim to radically reform the internal structures of these positions in order to promote absolute loyalty to the tribal way of life. With the tribal way of life now being promoted across all of Yemen, the Sheikhs control has now become absolute, with none left to oppose the tribes’ absolute rule."
yemen.81.o1: "The sheikhs of Yemen will secure our way of life."
yemen.82.t: "Sheikh Al-Ahmar Addresses the Nation"
yemen.82.d: "In a televised address to the nation, Sheikh Al-Ahmar has announced the end of the immediate reforms to Yemen and has proclaimed that Yemen is at last a nation where the tribes are dominant and tradition reigns as the sole law of the land. Throughout his speech, the Sheikh promised that whilst the initial reforms were now complete, the citizens of Yemen must not allow this to end the dream of a tribal nation encouraging all within the nation to work together to maintain and protect the future of tribal society. With Yemen now under the secure control of the tribes, Sheikh Al-Ahmar in his address to the nation continued to thank all citizens and the National Convention members that had originally elected him and his Tribal Council to the position of leader of the nation. Whilst initial reforms are now over, the Sheikh has maintain the belief that so long as he and the Tribal Council remain in power continued reforms shall always be enacted to ensure the survival of the tribal way of life."
yemen.82.o1: "Yemen belongs to the tribes!"
yemen.83.t: "Army Dispatched to the Streets"
yemen.83.d: "President Mahmoud al-Subaihi has today announced that the army will be sent to the streets to deal with the continued unrest that has persisted since the removal of al-Zindani from office. Following his decision to enforce his rule through the use of the military, protestors have only increased in numbers with demands for the President to recall the National Convention and allow for its members to elect a new President. Furthermore, the President's use of the army has drawn parallels with his predecessor with many protestors labelling the President as the “second Zindani”. With tanks now lining the streets and armed guards patrolling throughout the night, the situation since Zindani’s removal has scarcely improved with the President having few options to secure his rule. For the time being, until the President can effectively put an end to the unrest, the streets of Yemen remain in chaos with no clear ending in sight."
yemen.83.o1: "Only the army can put these rioters down."
yemen.84.t: "Establishing the Transitional Government"
yemen.84.d: "With the rioting in the streets only continuing to worsen, President al-Subaihi has today announced the beginning of the reformation of the Yemeni government announcing the creation of the transitional government. However, despite many believing that such an announcement would be the beginning of the restoration of democracy the President has instead announced that the transitional government will instead seek to re-invite the monarchy to Yemen who shall guide the nation forward how they see fit. Those within the President's inner circle have already stated their opposition to the plan, believing that even with the return of the monarchy the people will refuse to cease their rioting until an element of democracy has been restored to the nation. However, the President has dismissed their claims believing that the monarch will be the uniting figure Yemen needs in order for peace to be restored. Now, after abolishing the office of President and proclaiming himself to be the new Regent, al-Subaihi has now begun preparations for the return of the heir to the Rassid dynasty."
yemen.84.o1: "The monarchy will restore order to Yemen."
yemen.85.t: "Execution of al-Zindani"
yemen.85.d: "In an effort to continue to consolidate its rule over Yemen, the government has today reached the conclusion that in order to maintain stability and further increase support for the new government its internal enemies must be silenced. Following the collapse of his government, al-Zindani was arrested and sentenced to trial at a later date. However, the government’s decision has today overturned this and now al-Zindani along with several other leading officials and members are to be publicly executed with the Salafist Movement being subsequently outlawed. Across the nation there has been a mixed reaction to the government's decision with many criticising the suspension of Zindani’s trial believing that, whilst the outcome would not have been different, the right to a trial should not be impeded upon. Whilst others have supported the government’s decision for finally putting an end to the tyrant. With the execution of Zindani and his followers, the government has now furthered its control over the nation and has finally put an end to the tyrant despised by the masses."
yemen.85.o1: "The mad prophet has been at last silenced."
yemen.86.t: "Coronation of King Muadh I"
yemen.86.d: "After having been exiled following the end of the Yemeni civil war in 1966, the heir-apparent to the Yemeni throne has today returned to Yemen following an invitation from Regent al-Subaihi. Upon his arrival in Yemen, the Sana’a international airport received thousands of visitors many of which cheered at the sight of the returning monarch with others continuing to denounce the government as tyrannical. Having returned to his family home of Dar al-Hajar to be crowned as the King of Yemen, King Muadh was met with the nation's leading sheikhs and tribal leaders who had been invited to witness his coronation. Having played the anthem of the former Mutawakkilite Kingdom throughout his coronation, Regent al-Subaihi announced his immediate retirement from his position. However, al-Subaihi stated that he would remain in government to advise the King on matters regarding the military. Having now been crowned as the King of Yemen, Muadh the First now holds supreme authority over the nation with the future of the nation resting in his hands."
yemen.86.o1: "Long live Muadh the First!"
yemen.87.t: "Establishment of the Council of Advisors"
yemen.87.d: "Having now been crowned as the new King of Yemen and all official surrounding his coronation now ending, King Muadh has now called upon leading economists, military generals and scientists to form a privy council. This new Council of Advisors shall aim to guide the King through all reforms made to the nation and ensure that he remains aware of the economic and political situation within the country. With tensions surrounding the restoration of the monarchy ongoing the Council, having convened on request of the King, has offered to the King a solution that would resolve the matter but remove him from his role as an absolute monarch. This solution would see the monarchy be reformed into a constitutional monarchy with King Muadh being reduced to a figurehead with the government being made in his name and all new legislation requiring his consent. However, others within the Council have insisted that such a plan would lead to further instability and that the King should retain his absolute power and guide Yemen towards greatness. After fierce debate within the Council the King has now come to a decision."
yemen.87.o1: "The monarchy must reform if it is to survive"
yemen.87.o2: "The monarchy does not need reform."
yemen.88.t: "King Muadh Addresses the Council of Advisors"
yemen.88.d: "Today at the former presidential palace that has now been converted into government administrative offices in Sana’a, King Muadh held his first official meeting with that most important of monarchical institutions, the Council of Advisors. The Council, consisting of the most intelligent, resourceful and capable citizens of the Yemeni nation, serves as a trusted, guiding influence for the king in times when he must make decisions that he himself is not certain of. However, instead of the expected discussion of various reforms, the king stunned the council with a swift declaration, stating that various reformist proposals are nothing but arbitrary and capricious as well as unnecessary. “Absolute monarchy is all at once both the traditional and natural form of governance not just in Yemen but Arabia as whole.” the king said to his exasperated collection of advisors. “The reborn Mutawakkilite Kingdom must be governed just like the old one. That is the only way the wayward and lost people of Yemen can be saved from themselves.”"
yemen.88.o1: "What’s old is new again."
yemen.89.t: "King Muadh becomes Figurehead"
yemen.89.d: "Having now concluded meetings with his Council of Advisors, King Muadh has announced to the nation that he will be relaxing his role as the nation's monarch, allowing for the immediate reformation of the monarchy which shall reduce his role from an absolute monarch to a ceremonial constitutional monarch. Whilst elections have been called to appoint a Prime Minister and form a new government, the King has stated that until the election day arrives he shall remain in power to allow for a smooth transition of power. The promise made by the King has already boosted popularity for the monarchy with many who had been opposed to his continued rule now indifferent or in favour of the monarchy. However, despite this, elements of republicanism still exist throughout the nation with many still seeing the monarch as a tyrant brought back by the junta in an effort to appease the masses. With his stepping down as an absolute monarch, the King made a statement to the nation where he announced that all those who had been arrested for protesting against the al-Subaihi government would be released following a review of their involvement in the protests and that change was coming to Yemen with power now being in the hands of the people."
yemen.89.o1: "Yemen is on the path towards democracy."
yemen.90.t: "[Root.GetYear] General Election"
yemen.90.d: "Today, following increased demands from the Yemeni population and reform to the monarchy, the people of Yemen have been allowed for the first time in recent history to determine who shall lead the nation for the next four years free of government interference and corruption. In the first legitimate election since the end of the civil war, two parties have now led in the polls since the announcement of the general election: the Peace and Progress Party and the Social Alliance. The Peace and Progress Party, led by Mohammed Basindawa, has run on a platform of liberalisation of the Yemeni economy promising to expand upon the Yemeni trading network and find new trade partners across Europe and Asia. His party has also cited the need to modernise the army in order to defend the nation from all foreign threats. Their main opposition has stemmed from the Social Alliance, led by Nadia Al-Sakkaf, who has proposed similar legislation however believes that if Yemen is to properly advance from the days of Al-Islah then radical reform must take place across the economy through the promotion of labour rights and the establishment of anti-corruption measures. Now, with every vote counted the Yemeni people have chosen to elect…"
yemen.90.o1: "The Peace and Progress Party shall guide Yemen forward"
yemen.90.o2: "The Social Alliance will bring an end to corruption"
yemen.91.t: "Royal Funding Given for New Schools"
yemen.91.d: "In his first action since becoming a constitutional monarch, King Muadh has today approached Prime Minister Basindawa proposing to grant large sums of royal funding to aid in the government's continued efforts to construct new and modernise existing schools across the nation. Having pledged to offer the government its required funds of seven million rials, construction is expected to begin immediately with existing schools being rebuilt and being granted access to new equipment and materials. Whilst a large portion of the government’s efforts has been spent on schools for ages four to twelve, the government has also made a pledge to increase funding for high schools and universities promising that no child shall be left behind and no one receiving an education shall be abandoned. With the Kings kindheartedness, support for the continuation of the monarchy has once again increased and Prime Minister Basindawa has received a significant boost in his popularity. With the nation’s schools receiving such a large increase in funding, the Prime Minister has promised to maintain education as his top priority throughout his time in office, demonstrating a new beginning for Yemen."
yemen.91.o1: "Education is a right for all Yemeni citizens."
yemen.92.t: "Anti-Corruption Agency Established"
yemen.92.d: "Following the election of the Social Alliance, Prime Minister Al-Sakkaf has now fulfilled one of her manifesto promises and has established a series of anti-corruption agencies that will seek to tackle the leftover vestiges of corruption from the Al-Islah government. Once this task has been completed, the Prime Minister has stated that the agencies shall remain to ensure that Yemen remains an honest society. Already, several government officials who were previously loyal to the Al-Islah government have been found guilty of expense scandals with leading officials being charged with electoral fraud. These new agencies have not only looked into allegations of corruption with the former government but have also begun to look into accusations across several key businesses who were reported to have connections with the former government. With these agencies operating across the nation, the government hopes that within a year large scale corruption will be found and wiped out from Yemeni culture and that honestly can be restored to the soul of Yemen."
yemen.92.o1: "Corruption has no place in Yemen, now is the time for healing."
yemen.93.t: "The North Seeks Peace"
yemen.93.d: "In direct continuation of the initial peace talks that began with the Prime Minister reaching out to our foreign office earlier this year, the North has today continued their calls for peace and has offered leading ambassadors to come to Taizz to discuss the future of our two nations. With our ambassadors stating the intentions of the negotiations are to put an official end to the hostilities between our two nations, many within our government have supported the negotiations believing that the North can be trusted with their calls for peace. However, whilst the intentions of the North may be pure and in the best of our two nations interests, others within the government have stated that the North cannot be trusted to maintain this peace and that with our defences lowered their government shall invade and reunify Yemen under their monarchist banner. Whilst this possibility is slim, many feel that the North would not hesitate to invade upon the lowering of our defences. With the North now awaiting our response, we shall have to finally decide whether we can place the past behind us and trust in the North to maintain a new era of peace or continue with the decades-long rivalry between our two nations."
yemen.93.o1: "Peace will be enshrined for generations to come"
yemen.93.o2: "The North cannot be trusted"
yemen.94.t: "The South Agrees to Peace"
yemen.94.d: "Following their acceptance to attend our meeting in Taizz, Southern diplomats have today arrived in the city to discuss the future of our two nations. With every one in attendance believing that peace between our two nations is the only logical conclusion of the meeting, it did not take long for our diplomats and theirs to reach an agreement. Despite initial fears from the South that our government would use such peace to invade at a moment of their weakness, these fears were soon quelled after promises that any agreement made would see a ten mile long demilitarised zone between our two countries. Now with the Taizz Accords signed, from today forward both of our nations have agreed to the desired demilitarised borders, establishing a clear non-aggression pact between us, and that should either side ever face attack from another nation the other would not hesitate to come to the aid of the other. With the signature of the Accords, a new era of peace has been established in our small corner of Arabia, a peace that we hope to maintain for the foreseeable future."
yemen.94.o1: "After decades of conflict, peace has now returned to Yemen."
yemen.95.t: "The South Refuses Peace"
yemen.95.d: "Following the Prime Minister's invitation to southern ambassadors to discuss a new era of peace between our two nations, news has today arrived in the capital that the South has refused our invitation to finally end the hostilities between our two nations. The rejection to attend the meeting in Taizz has stemmed from fears that any such agreement would leave the south in a weakened position and that our government would use this to our advantage and attempt to unify Yemen once more. Despite attempts to explain that these fears have no basis in any reality and that our intentions are to ensure peace for the foreseeable future, the South has refused to discuss the matter further and has now expelled the ambassadors sent to attempt to negotiate peace. With this set back in peace talks, the future of our corner of Arabia continues to be shrouded in conflict and division with no clear end in sight."
yemen.95.o1: "Perhaps peace shall come from the next generation."
yemen.96.t: "Trial of the Southern Leadership"
yemen.96.d: "With the capture of the southern capital, and their capitulation soon thereafter, the leaders of the communist regime have now been captured and await trial for their crimes against the newly reunited Yemeni state and its people. Having been accused of crimes against humanity the leader of the former People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, [PDY.Getleader], is likely to face the brunt of the charges with the only possible outcome being a swift execution if found to be guilty. Despite the charges the former General Secretary has maintained their innocence stating that the accusations placed upon them are not based in reality and that the north has fabricated these claims to justify a purge of the southern leadership and reinforce northern hegemony over the region. Along with [PDY.Getleader], the former southern military has also been tried being accused of war crimes with its leading generals also awaiting trial for their crimes. With the courts now finding both the former General Secretary and leading military officials guilty, Prime Minister [YEM.Getleader] can now begin working to reconstruct the south and bring about a new age of prosperity in the region."
yemen.96.o1: "The tyrants have been dealt with and Yemen is once more united!"
yemen.97.t: "Yemeni Delegates Seek Non-Aggression Pact"
yemen.97.d: "Yemeni delegates have today approached our government in an effort to further the recent renegotiations of trade between our two countries, now they have presented our government with a demand of a non-aggression pact to solidify this new era of diplomacy between our two nations. Many have already pledged their support for the idea, believing that the only way to secure this new era of diplomacy with Yemen is to sign this declaration and demonstrate to Yemen that we shall no longer attempt to subvert their politics or economy. Furthermore, many believe that Yemen has proven itself to be a valuable ally in the region, and that agreeing to a  non-aggression pact would ensure an everlasting friendship between our two countries.  However, others within our government believe that such a declaration is meaningless and that we have already demonstrated to Yemen that our foreign policy towards their nation has changed through the signature of the renewed trade agreements. Regardless of our decision, a new era of politics has been achieved with Yemen, and our decision here will determine whether this continues or falls apart before it has even properly begun."
yemen.97.o1: "There shall be peace between our nations"
yemen.97.o2: "Our new trade deals are more than satisfactory"
yemen.98.t: "Saudi Arabia Accepts Non-Aggression Pact"
yemen.98.d: "Our ambassadors have today been informed that Suadi Arabia has agreed to our request of a non-aggression pact between our two countries, solidifying our unofficial alliance for the foreseeable future. Already our two nations have begun the preparations of demilitarising our borders to demonstrate that we are both committed to the new non-aggression pact. Furthermore, Prime Minister [YEM.Getleader] has already announced a second visit to Saudi Arabia to confirm the non-aggression pact and reveal to both our nation and Saudi Arabia that a new era has begun between our two countries. The Saudi’s acceptance of our request has been well received across Yemen with our population praising our government for establishing a friendly relationship with our former foe, now with the non-aggression pact signed peace has been brought to Yemen and Saudi Arabia."
yemen.98.o1: "This non-aggression pact will secure peace for decades."
yemen.99.t: "Saudi Arabia Refuses Non-Aggression Pact"
yemen.99.d: "Our ambassadors have today returned from their attempted negotiations with the Saudi Arabian government where they have aimed to secure a non-aggression pact from the country which would have ensured peace between our two nations for decades to come. However, instead of agreeing to our request the Saudi Arabian government has instead refused to sign a non-aggression pact stating that there is no need when our ambassadors have already renegotiated a fairer trade deal between our two nations. When pressed about the matter, with our ambassadors stating that the people of Yemen would be grateful for a non-aggression pact, the Saudi Arabian ambassadors responded by stating they did not wish to further the negotiations and that Yemen should be satisfied with the new favourable trade deals. The lack of an official declaration of non-aggression has worried many within our nation, with many seeing the Saudi’s decline as a telling statement that they have not changed their stance towards Yemen."
yemen.99.o1: "The new trade deals will have to suffice."
yemen.100.t: "Prime Minister [YEM.Getleader] Meets Sultan Al Saud"
yemen.100.d: "Following initial meetings between our two nations ambassadors, Prime Minister [YEM.Getleader] has today met with the Sultan of Oman in an effort to secure a new trade agreement between our two nations. Despite our past relations with the Omani government being relatively warm, very little trade ever took place between the Al-Islah government and Oman with Saudi Arabia remaining one of the sole forms of income for the former government. Now after weeks of negotiations and meetings between ambassadors, the Prime Minister has ensured a new era of diplomacy between Yemen and Oman is to begin, effectively immediately. The Prime Minister has promised that ambassadors to Oman have secured a fairer trade deal with their government, allowing for both our nations to prosper together rather than one benefit more than the other. For the moment it is unclear as to whether these negotiations will be taken further, however, many remain hopeful that these new trade agreements will remain in place and that both Yemen and Oman may prosper."
yemen.100.o1: "A new era of Yemeni-Saudi diplomacy has begun"
yemen.101.t: "Yemen Seeks to Join Our Faction"
yemen.101.d: "Yemeni ambassadors have today approached our government requesting to join our military alliance and bring about a new hegemony within the Middle East. Many have already expressed their support for Yemeni entry into our faction, listing the obvious benefits such an alliance would give such as access to the Red Sea as well as further access to vital oil deposits that will benefit our war effort against the despotic regimes in the region. However, others have been more sceptical of allowing Yemeni entry into our faction. Critics have stated that Yemen has very little to offer in terms of military capacity, both in terms of the size of its army and their ineffectiveness in combat, furthermore these same critics believe that their entry would do nothing more than antagonise their neighbours who are not allied to us prompting the beginning of wars neither we nor Yemen are ready to fight. With the Yemeni ambassadors eagerly awaiting our response, we have determined that..."
yemen.101.o1: "Yemen shall be welcomed with open arms"
yemen.101.o2: "We shall not risk antagonising Yemen’s neighbours"
yemen.102.t: "Syria Welcomes Us"
yemen.102.d: "Our ambassadors have today returned from their negotiations with Syrian delegates where they have been discussing the potential for our entry into their faction, and have reported that the Syrian government has welcomed us into their faction with open arms after realising the benefits of having a close ally with access to the Red Sea. This alliance has now been reported to many across the Middle East who, as expected by the Syrian government during our initial negotiations phase, have viewed our entrance with hostility. However, our ambassadors to these nations have already begun work ensuring that none of our neighbours continue to feel threatened by our entrance into the Syrian faction. With our entry, and the Syrians at our side, Middle Eastern democracy has a new guardian and our two nations will work tirelessly to ensure that democracy is upheld and that both our nations prosper."
yemen.102.o1: "A toast to our new Syrian friends"
yemen.103.t: "Syria Rejects Us"
yemen.103.d: "Syrian ambassadors have today replied to our request for entry into their faction, much to the disappointment of many the Syrians have denied our request. Having stated that our entrance into their faction may bring about unintended consequences and hostilities with non-member states on our borders, the Syrians have rejected our request and have now refused to discuss the matter further in case of a rise in tensions with its neighbours. Many within the government have accused the Syrian government of cowardice and a lack of trust in our nation, believing that if any tensions had arisen with our neighbours our ambassadors would have been able to ensure that their fears were eased. However, with the Syrians refusal our ambitions to safeguard democracy in Arabia have now been pushed back and it seems unlikely that Syria will change its mind on this matter any time soon."
yemen.103.o1: "We can only rely on ourselves"
yemen.104.t: "Yemen seeks to join the Democratic League"
yemen.104.d: "Yemeni ambassadors have today approached our government requesting to become a member of the Democratic League, whilst this request does not come as a surprise following Yemen’s recent transition to a functioning constitutional monarchy many within our cabinet are still surprised by the request believing that Yemen would have preferred to remain an isolated state within Arabia. Whilst many have supported the notion believing that a state in the Middle East allied to the Democratic League will prove invaluable in the continued fight against the Warsaw Pact, especially one with close access to the Red Sea, others feel the opposite. Those in opposition to Yemen’s entry into the League believe that due to Yemen’s recent civil war and its continued recovery, millions of dollars will have to be spent in order to aid their recovery as well as train their army to be an effective force. Whilst this has never been an issue before, Yemen’s location in the Middle East makes shipping to the region a long and strenuous venture thus meaning increased spending on defence."
yemen.104.o1: "Yemen will prove to be a valuable ally"
yemen.104.o2: "Yemen will be more of a hindrance to us than an ally"
yemen.105.t: "Canada Accepts"
yemen.105.d: "Canadian ambassadors have today responded to our requests for a Yemeni entry into the Democratic League. After much debate within the Canadian parliament, and across the various member states of the Democratic League, the Canadians have today announced that our request has been accepted and that we now stand as a staunch ally to the democratic cause across the world. Already, Canadian ships have embarked from Nova Scotia setting sail for our ports with their newfound access to the Red Sea. This alliance has been praised by all across the Democratic League who have recognised our strategic location in Arabia as well as our access to vital oil reserves. With our entry into the Democratic League, we have made our presence known on the international stage and made it clear that we side with the democratic will of the people."
yemen.105.o1: "Yemen has now entered the international stage."
yemen.106.t: "Canada Refuses"
yemen.106.d: "Canadian ambassadors have today responded to our request to join the Democratic League, and to the surprise of many within our government the Canadian government has rejected our request stating that the distance between our two nations and the funds required to ensure consistent trade are too great to justify our entry into the League. Furthermore, the Canadians have stated that our recent civil war would hinder our ability to contribute to the League’s motives and would only siphon funds from the Canadian government to aid in our recovery. Whilst our government had never made demands of the Canadians to aid in our economic recovery, it is evident that the Canadians feel they would be obliged to help in our recovery. Despite our ambassador's best attempts it is clear that the Canadian government will not be persuaded otherwise on this issue and that our nation must stand alone against the tyranny across the Arabian peninsula."
yemen.106.o1: "We shall stand alone against tyranny"
yemen.107.t: "Military Swears Loyalty to King Muadh"
yemen.107.d: "The true power of the reborn Yemeni crown was solidified today when a delegation of military leaders led by Mahmoud al-Subaihi, the man largely responsible for the events that led to restoration of the Yemeni crown, formally swore fealty to King Muadh. This declaration of loyalty has brought a sigh of relief to many Yemenis weary of conflict in their government. While unlikely, rumors of another possible coup against the monarchy by dissident members of the armed forces have become very widespread in recent weeks, making many in the nation fearful that Yemen may never truly know stability and peace. At the ceremony today, King Muadh showed immense satisfaction to have a military high command loyal to him and to Yemen rather than themselves like the hated Ahmed Saleh. “A nation is only ever as strong as those who are given the privilege of defending it. Far too often, those trusted with the ultimate power of military might use for their own ends rather than to protect others. We have seen this through the actions of the traitor Saleh. With this oath of fealty, General Subaihi and his comrades have truly put aside every selfish machination in order to serve their country to the fullest.”"
yemen.107.o1: "No more Napoleons"
yemen.108.t: "King Muadh Meets with Sheikhs"
yemen.108.d: "King Muadh’s latest meeting today has been with the representatives of that most traditional of Yemeni institutions: the sheikhs. The unrest that led up to and followed with the recent civil war made many tribal leaders fearful that their very way of life was under threat and that they would end up being swept away by the uncaring forces of the twenty-first century. These fears proved to be unfounded as the king has been more than willing to accommodate the Yemeni tribes who were long loyal to the old Yemen he wishes so dearly to resurrect. Muadh, in dialogue with a tribal delegation led by Sadiq Al-Ahmar, a sheikh from the Hashid tribe that is largely credited with rallying the tribes in support of the government during the civil war. Besides the expected concessions such as mandated legislative representation and local authority over their lands, King Muadh has made it a point of honor to make certain that “those who still adhere to the same way of life as the Prophet need never be fearful to live as they choose.”"
yemen.108.o1: "The crown protects the keepers of the flame."
yemen.109.t: "Corporations and King Meet"
yemen.109.d: "King Muadh’s next meeting took place today on the top floor of a posh skyscraper in Sana’a that had been spared by the fighting in the recent civil war. There, he spoke with a collection of prominent Yemeni businessmen and industrialists concerned about the future of their enterprises amid the turmoil of the recent civil war that was soon followed by the shocking ascension to power and subsequent rapid downfall of the late Sheikh al-Zindani. Seeking to calm the fears of the Yemeni business community after the difficult time the country has experienced the last several years, the king suggested that many valuable incentives should be granted to companies that support the government. “You, our nation’s great lords of commerce, hold in your hands the key to the Yemen of tomorrow. Perhaps this gives you a power that rivals even that of the Mutawakkilite crown itself. Nevertheless, we both have a great opportunity to come together as Yemenis and use the resources we have to finally bring our country past all of the many bad things it has had to endure for longer than most of us can even remember.”"
yemen.109.o1: "The hand of the market will push our kingdom into the future"
yemen.110.t: "Zaidism Promoted Throughout Yemen"
yemen.110.d: "With the other important segments of Yemeni society placated, King Muadh took the opportunity to discuss something more personal today. Speaking before various religious figures, most prominently several former Houthis leaders, the king outlined plans to once again make the Zaidiyyah sect of Shia Islam the offical state religion while at the same time maintaining a society where different religious faiths can be freely practiced without fear of persecution. Formerly the official religion of the old Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, followers of Zaidism currently make up around thirty five percent of the population as well as the majority of the Yemeni Shia Muslims. Further on, the king even alluded to the possibility of allowing for a reconstitution of the Houthi organization Ansar Allah but this time closer to its broad-minded roots and without the militant extremism that later came to define the Houthi movement. “With all our efforts concentrated on this goal,” Muadh said, “a pluralist Yemen may come within our lifetimes."
yemen.110.o1: "The King protects our inalienable religious freedom"
yemen.111.t: "King Muadh Meets with al-Houthi"
yemen.111.d: "Today, in an effort to continue on his promise of promoting Zaidism across Yemen, King Muadh has invited Abdul-Malik al-Houthi to the royal palace hoping to establish an official alliance between the government and the most influential Zaidi organization in our nation. Having accepted the invitation al-Houthi arrived at the Dar-al Hajar in the early hours of the morning where he soon began negotiations with the King. Over the course of several hours the Houthi leader sat in near silence as the King explained his intentions to welcome the Houthi movement into the government, where it would act as the guardians of Zaidism ensuring its values were upheld and promoted where necessary. Whilst eager to accept this proposal, al-Houthi was quick to reconsider once the King demanded that should he accept the Houthi movement must moderate its activities, allowing for other religions to coexist alongside Zaidism. Despite his initial rejection, al-Houthi was quick to reconsider after the King stated that other leading Zaidi figures were available to take up this position as “guardians of Zaidism”. Now with this acceptance, the Houthi movement has been all but pacified and for the first time in decades the religious divide in Yemen has been eased."
yemen.111.o1: "Our Houthi brethren shall protect Zaidism"
yemen.112.t: "Trial of the Socialist Party Leadership"
yemen.112.d: "Now that the illegitimate communist regime in the south of Yemen has been disposed of, it is time to bring those responsible for splitting our country in two as it had been during the Cold War to justice. This in particular means prosecuting the leadership of the traitorous Yemen Socialist Party who, after years of militant terrorism, established a one-party dictatorship in the south. In addition to figures such as [PDY.Getleader], numerous civilian and military leaders who had collaborated with the socialists either during their insurgency and during the period of the rebellion have also been brought to trial with charges ranging from light treason through the abetting of the PDRY to crimes against humanity based on actions committed during the recent civil war. Commenting on the events from his palace, King Muadh stated “This ongoing trial is more than mere legal proceedings. It represents a vital step in the process of reunification and reconciliation between the two halves of our country that remain scarred and haunted by the shadow of a turbulent past.”"
yemen.112.o1: "Those who caused so much suffering must pay the price."
yemen.113.t: "Yemen Demands the Dhofar Pass"
yemen.113.d: "A delegation from the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen arrived in Muscat today to issue demands that we cede the Dhofar Pass to them. While the Yemeni delegates never said the words exactly, the clear implication is that if their demands are denied, Yemen will take the Dhofar Pass by force. Of course, the idea that we would willingly give up such a sizable chunk of our territory is practically unthinkable; such an action would make us look weak to international observers and our own civilians alike, which could very easily destabilize our regime. There is also always the hope that the Yemeni officials are bluffing about their willingness to go to war, which is a possibility given that they just recently concluded a bitter and bloody civil war. However, such a hope is likely in vain. Yemen’s military is one of the strongest in the region, having been rapidly expanded and modernized by the newly crowned King [YEM.Getleader]. Our odds of surviving any conflict with Yemen are desperately low, making this whole situation nearly hopeless. Either we accept Yemen’s demands and lose land and legitimacy, or we refuse them and risk a war that could cause us to lose everything else too."
yemen.113.o1: "Accept Yemen’s demands"
yemen.113.o2: "We will never bow to threats of violence!"
yemen.114.t: "Oman Agrees to Hand Over Dhofar Pass"
yemen.114.d: "Our delegation to Oman has returned reporting that the Omani government has caved to our demands, and now recognizes the Dhofar region as the rightful and lawful territory of the Yemeni Kingdom. Already our troops and government officials are en route to the towns and bases in the area, informing civilians of changes in laws and regulations and overseeing the smooth transfer of military installations. His royal majesty King [YEM.Getleader] is expected to take a tour of the region later this week and deliver a speech to the people of the Dhofar Pass. This momentous occasion is an important step forward towards restoring the past glory of Yemen, and the fact that it was done without bloodshed is something that will surely be noted by powers of the world, as it demonstrates both our diplomatic prowess and the fear that we inspire in our neighbors. Access to the territory’s manpower, industry, and natural resources will also certainly assist in the rapid development of our kingdom, putting us on a sure-fire course to becoming the premier power in the Middle East."
yemen.114.o1: "Fantastic news!"
yemen.115.t: "Oman Refuses to Hand Over Dhofar Pass"
yemen.115.d: "Our delegation has returned from Muscat reporting that the Omani government has foolishly refused our demands for them to cede the Dhofar Pass to us. Refusing to recognize our historic claim on the territory, the Omani administration has informed us that if King [YEM.Getleader] wants the region so badly, then he must be prepared for war. Naturally, we have already begun dispatching troops to the Omani border, and the Omani government surely already recognizes that Yemen’s military forces are many times the strength of Oman’s. While this turn of events is frustrating, King [YEM.Getleader] has expressed a degree of admiration for their willingness to go down fighting. Nevertheless, their honor will not save them, as we must pursue our ambitions of restoring Yemen’s historic glory by any and all means. This war should be over quite quickly, Allah willing."
yemen.115.o1: "We will take what is rightfully ours"
yemen.116.t: "Yemen Demands Lost Territory"
yemen.116.d: "This morning, a detachment of royal diplomats representing Yemen’s newly crowned King Muadh arrived to negotiate with our officials. At least, that was the official reason for their presence in our country. The reality of the situation is that these diplomats have come to wave around threats and attempt to bully us into giving in to their outrageous demands. They are claiming that the territories of Najaran, Jizan, Asir, Qunfudah, and Al-Badha rightfully belong to Yemen, and that we must either cede these lands to them or ready ourselves for imminent war. Most of our officials currently view these demands as utterly laughable. No matter how much Yemen’s capabilities have advanced since the crowning of King Muadh, it is still a miniscule rump state that only recently recovered from a bitter civil war. The odds of Yemen’s army being anywhere near comparable to ours is practically non-existent. Despite this, there are a handful of opposition members in our government that feel it’s safest to just give up the disputed territories, spouting inane pleasantries about the “incalculable” value of human life. Nevertheless, their position is technically one we could take, should we choose to, even if it would humiliate us on the world scale and cost us a significant amount of territory."
yemen.116.o1: "Cede the contested territories"
yemen.117.t: "Saudi Arabia Returns Our Historic Territory"
yemen.117.d: "When we dispatched our royal negotiators to Saudi Arabia to demand the return of our rightful territories, very few in our nation had actually expected that the Saudis would willingly give up the land. However, in a surprise turn of events, the Saudi government has decided to peacefully cede the territories of Najaran, Jizan, Asir, Qunfudah, and Al-Badha to us, dramatically expanding our borders and increasing the quantity of resources available to us. This grand achievement has served to draw yet more public attention and respect to our glorious King Muadh, who has done so much for Yemen in such a short amount of time. For the first time in centuries, Southern Arabia has emerged as a consolidated political entity, one that is sure to upset the balance of power in the region, and this groundbreaking accomplishment has been done without resorting to a violent conflict against our largest neighbor."
yemen.117.o1: "Glory to King Muadh!"
yemen.118.t: "Saudi Arabia Refuses to Return Historic Lands"
yemen.118.d: "Following a period of short negotiations with Saudi diplomats, the King has today been informed that the demands for the return of historic Yemeni lands has been rejected by the Saudi Arabian government who have branded our claims as an insult to their nation and to friendship that had seemingly existed between our two nations. Despite this outright rejection the King has made it clear to the Council of Advisors that the matter of the return of Yemen’s historic lands is not a concluded matter having demanded that the Council begin preparations to mobilise the army and to send a formal declaration of war to Saudi Arabia. After fierce debate within the Council, with a minority attempting to persuade the King to accept the Saudi’s rejection, the King has now forced the hand of his field marshals with the army being mobilised on the Yemeni-Saudi border. Now, with a formal state of war being declared between us and the Saudi goliath, the future of these regions and our continued existence rests in the capable hands of our military."
yemen.118.o1: "Death to Saudi Arabia! These lands are rightfully ours!"
yemen.119.t: "King [YEM.Getleader] Proclaims the Greater Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen"
yemen.119.d: "Today is a day of celebration and merriment throughout Yemen, as King [YEM.Getleader] has proclaimed the achievement of a Greater Mutawakkilite Kingdom. With the guiding force of Yemen’s newly restored monarch, the nation has expanded from a forgotten rump state on the edge of Arabia to the premier force on the peninsula. Not all have been pleased by this momentous occasion, with scattered ideological opponents such as communists, republicans, and nasserists retaining vitriol towards Yemen’s great king. Many of those living in newly acquired lands also remain dissatisfied with the rule of the Yemeni crown, holding onto the national identities of the countries they once belonged to. Of course, these dissenters are few and far between, with the king and his royal guards assuring that they remain weak, disorganized, and without a platform. The king will spend the rest of this week touring his great realm, with parades planned in every notable town and city. To protect his highness on this great tour, the royal guard will naturally accompany him as he meets with his loyal subjects."
yemen.119.o1: "Yemen has truly become a world power"
yemen.120.t: "Yemen Seeks to Join the Moscow Accords"
yemen.120.d: "A royal delegation from the Greater Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen arrived today to negotiate acceptance into the Moscow Accords. King [YEM.Getleader] himself has joined this delegation in an effort to personally oversee negotiations and demonstrate his dedication to cooperation. That said, the man is far from humble, and several members of our own delegation have reported feeling belittled by the Yemeni monarch, who seems either to not notice or not care. It seems that many of our representatives would rather not allow Yemen into our faction, however, our own head of state, [RUS.Getleader] has overruled this initial reaction, preferring to meet personally meet [YEM.Getleader] before making a judgement, stating that Yemen represents a potentially valuable ally that shouldn’t be discarded based off of a knee-jerk reaction. After all, Yemen’s political system bears some similarity to our own, making them a useful ideological ally. Furthermore, the Yemeni armed forces are some of the most well trained in the Arab world, giving us a powerful strategic ally in the region. And of course, all of this is not to mention the great wealth of natural resources that lie in the soils of Yemen, resources that Russia could get at a greatly discounted price should we welcome the Yemenis into our faction."
yemen.120.o1: "We welcome Yemen into the Moscow Accords"
yemen.120.o2: "Reject their petition"
yemen.121.t: "Russia Accepts"
yemen.121.d: "We have received word that our negotiations to join the Moscow Accords have resulted in a stunning success, with the Russians welcoming us in with open arms. Negotiations were personally overseen by our great King [YEM.Getleader], and while they got off to a rocky start, a series of personal conversations with Russia’s own head of state, [RUS.Getleader], resulted in a calming of tensions and an overall atmosphere of cooperation. Yemen and Russia do, after all, share much in common, such as each of us having only recently driven the communist menace out of our countries. Furthermore, both our countries trend towards conservative social policies, and have a distinct spirit of militarism and anti-liberalism. These various similarities make us natural allies. Of course, Yemen’s mineral wealth, impressive military, and strategic location don’t hurt either."
yemen.121.o1: "Allies until the bitter end"
yemen.122.t: "Russia Declines"
yemen.122.d: "We have received word that our negotiations to join the Moscow Accords have resulted in a humiliating failure, with the Russians denying any hopes of us joining their faction. Our great King [YEM.Getleader] personally oversaw negotiations, and this decision may well have been what spelled the doom of our chance at joining the Moscow Accords, as his royal highness was less than well received by the Russian delegation, and failed to bring [RUS.Getleader] to see our point of view. Despite our shared experiences in expunging communists from our lands and our somewhat congruent views on many social and political issues, the Russians have denounced us as a “diplomatic liability” that they have no intentions of working with in the near future. Despite our strategic location, considerable military strength, and extensive resource wealth that could all serve Russia’s purposes in the conflicts that are clearly right around the corner, they apparently view our regime as too unstable and immature to serve as a valuable ally on the world stage."
yemen.122.o1: "They will regret this"
yemen.123.t: "Contacting the Muslim Brotherhood"
yemen.123.d: "The Muslim Brotherhood, an international organization with views and goals similar to that of the Emirate of Yemen will certainly be a important ally when our faithful nation makes its return to the world stage, ready to unite the Ummah against threats from enemies everywhere. Indeed, Emir Zindani himself founded and led the Yemeni branch of the Muslim Brotherhood for much of his life, so his experience and contacts with the wider movement across the Middle East could be nothing but good for our effort to build a formal alliance. Said formal alliance will be building on the basis of the Muslim Brotherhood’s theoretical efforts, translating them into something practical and something that will definitely bring the Ummah closer. Diplomats and foreign ministry employees have been scrambled all over the Muslim nations of the Middle East, making contact with both government and Muslim Brotherhood representitives, and discussions, negotiations, and proposals are gaining more and more momentum by the minute. Saudi Arabia, the major patron of jihad ever since the end of the Cold War, will be a major boon for the alliance if it joins, as many Muslim countries will probably follow in its footsteps if it decides to do so."
yemen.123.o1: "For a united Ummah!"
yemen.124.t: "Invitation to the Muslim Brotherhood"
yemen.124.d: "This morning, a Yemeni delegation arrived in Riyadh to negotiate Saudi Arabia’s potential entrance into their faction, the Muslim Brotherhood. This move has been expected since the earliest stages of the Brotherhood’s planning, and many observers have pinned responsibility for the long term survival of the alliance on whether or not we decide to join. Historically, our two countries have been closely tied and enjoyed good relationships. However, the recent events in Yemen have made the matter a bit more complicated. Zindani’s ousting of Al-Islah has been controversial to many in Arabia, as Al-Islah was a widely respected figurehead for tribal dominance. However, despite Zindani’s movement away from tribalism and general fascistic tendencies, his Islamacist ideology still maintains a semblance of coherence with our own governmental policies. Yemen could very well prove to be a valuable ally, it is merely a matter of whether or not we wish to align ourselves with such a volatile state."
yemen.124.o1: "We accept Yemen’s invitation"
yemen.124.o2: "Yemen is too unstable"
yemen.125.t: "Saudi Arabia Joins the Muslim Brotherhood"
yemen.125.d: "Massive elation has gripped Yemen today as Saudi Arabia has officially accepted our nation’s invitation to become a founding member of the Muslim Brotherhood! Street celebrations are happening all across the country to celebrate the massive announcement, and Emir Zindani is expected to address the nation when he returns from Riyadh tomorrow evening. While many Yemenis celebrate this as a triumph for their nation, many others still are celebrating it as a victory for the Muslim world and the Middle East as well. Saudi Arabia’s entrance will herald the rise of the Brotherhood from an idea to something that can change the Muslim world for the better. While reactions inside Yemen itself have been overwhelmingly positive, and there is a sense of animation across the rest of the Middle East, reception from the unbelieving world has been predictably negative. Godless nations, whether they be communist or capitalist, have criticized Yemen’s government for links to jihadist extremism and intolerance against secular and minority citizens, and have denounced Saudi Arabia’s decision to affiliate with us in an alliance. Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia’s entry has ensured the survival of the Brotherhood as a long term effort to unite the Ummah against all who threaten it."
yemen.125.o1: "The Ummah becomes one step closer to unification."
yemen.126.t: "Saudi Arabia Refuses to Join the Muslim Brotherhood"
yemen.126.d: "Shock has gripped the nation as Saudi Arabia has announced it’s decision to refuse entry into the Muslim Brotherhood! After weeks of negotiations, the Yemeni delegation present in Riyadh had left for Sana’a last night suddenly, without any explanations from either side. This morning, at a news conference with reporters from across the world, representatives of the King and the Foreign Ministry claimed that the government of Saudi Arabia “could not see” what benefits entering the Brotherhood could bring to the country. They also questioned the intentions of Zindani, asking if the alliance was really meant to unite the Muslim world, or perperutate Islamist extremism and to delegitmizethe infleunce of currently existing organizations like the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Now, as the official announcement has reached the majority of Yemenis, the startling reality is beginning to settle in for Zindani and our nation. The building of a united Ummah will have to proceed without the Land of the Prophet…"
yemen.126.o1: "A great misfortune for our budding Brotherhood."
yemen.127.t: "Yemen Demands Regime Change"
yemen.127.d: "This morning, representatives from the Islamic Emirate of Yemen arrived in Muscat to demand the immediate change of our government! In their address, the Yemeni delegates denounced the House of Al-Said, calling its rule “detrimental and harmful” to the Omani people and condemning the monarchy’s corruption, incompetence, and heretical opulence. The solution proposed by Yemen is a peaceful transfer of power from the monarchy to a government based on the “righteous” path of Islam and Sharia law. While it was not explicitly said in the announcement, we can safely assume that the Emirate will involve itself in this transfer of power, likely rendering us a subservient vassal state to them. It’s been known for some time now that Yemen has been trying to spread its Islamic fundamentalist ideology throughout the Middle East through its Muslim Brotherhood, but this is the first instance of the Emirate employing the threat of force to do so. The Yemeni military has expanded greatly since the conclusion of their civil war, and our estimate is that we would be quickly overwhelmed. However, should we really sign away our mandate without a fight?"
yemen.127.o1: "Acquiesce to Yemen’s demands"
yemen.127.o2: "We won’t surrender without a fight"
yemen.128.t: "Oman Installs New Government"
yemen.128.d: "Just as we had hoped, the Omani government has submitted to our just demands, with nearly all officials resigning from their posts this morning. King [OMA.GetLeader] arrived in Sana’a shortly thereafter to discuss the transfer of power with Zindani. While the details are still being worked out, the new Omani government will be composed of Islamic fundamentalists handpicked by our administration, and most titles will be subject to change or revocation should we see fit. Somewhat surprisingly, Oman’s military has agreed to abide by this transfer of power, and has already set out to keep the anti-fundamentalist protests from getting out of hand. We had initially offered our own military support in ensuring the smooth transition of power, but it seems that the Omani armed forces have things under control for the time being. International observers have widely condemned us for this so-called “act of aggression,” but their hate means little when Yemen now basks in the light of Allah’s favor."
yemen.128.o1: "Another member of the Ummah has joined us!"
yemen.129.t: "Oman Refuses to Install New Government"
yemen.129.d: "It would appear that the Omani government has rejected our demands for a regime change, calling our demands “utterly outrageous,” and saying that they would “never bow to an abhorrent fascist regime” like ours. Of course, this response isn’t unsurprising, and Zindani does not make hollow threats. Already our armed forces are preparing the invasion of Oman. If they will not willingly submit to the righteous laws of Allah, then we will convince them with force. Yemen’s military capacity has expanded greatly in the time since the civil war, whereas Oman has remained stagnant. It is expected that we will crush them with minimal effort. Soon the heretical opulence and blatant infidelity of the Omani ruling class will be put on full display for the world to see, and it will be dismantled with equal visibility. Allah’s will is clear, and we are nothing if not the instruments of His plans."
yemen.129.o1: "A poor choice, one that you will pay dearly for"
yemen.130.t: "Establishment of the Arab Doctrine"
yemen.130.d: "Already the Islamic Emirate of Yemen has accomplished more than any other Islamist administration in living memory, with much of Southern Arabia bowing to the righteous path that we have set them on, and yet Allah’s will is still not fulfilled. Northwards there still remain states of heretics, states of people who call themselves Muslims and yet prioritize their own comfort over the sanctity of Allah’s law. Their lavishness, their opulence, their fornication, their drunkenness; all of these things are held as abominations in the eyes of the Lord, and cannot be permitted to persist. In an address given early this afternoon, Emir Zindani unveiled the Arab Doctrine, a new policy that declares that Yemen is bound by duty and faith to spread the glory of true Islam to all of Arabia. Soon, Sharia law will be rightfully instated from as far south as Yemen and Oman to the peninsula’s northern regions in Iraq and Syria. Arabia is, after all, the favored land of Allah, and the birthplace of His prophet."
yemen.130.o1: "Allah’s will cannot be denied!"
yemen.131.t: "The North Seeks Peace"
yemen.131.d: "In direct continuation of the initial peace talks that began with the Prime Minister reaching out to our foreign office earlier this year, the North has today continued their calls for peace and has offered leading ambassadors to come to Taizz to discuss the future of our two nations. With our ambassadors stating the intentions of the negotiations are to put an official end to the hostilities between our two nations, many within our government have supported the negotiations believing that the North can be trusted with their calls for peace. However, whilst the intentions of the North may be pure and in the best of our two nations interests, others within the government have stated that the North cannot be trusted to maintain this peace and that with our defences lowered their government shall invade and reunify Yemen under their monarchist banner. Whilst this possibility is slim, many feel that the North would not hesitate to invade upon the lowering of our defences. With the North now awaiting our response, we shall have to finally decide whether we can place the past behind us and trust in the North to maintain a new era of peace or continue with the decades-long rivalry between our two nations."
yemen.131.o1: "Peace will be enshrined for generations to come"
yemen.131.o2: "The North cannot be trusted"
yemen.132.t: "The South Agrees to Peace"
yemen.132.d: "Following their acceptance to attend our meeting in Taizz, Southern diplomats have today arrived in the city to discuss the future of our two nations. With every one in attendance believing that peace between our two nations is the only logical conclusion of the meeting, it did not take long for our diplomats and theirs to reach an agreement. Despite initial fears from the South that our government would use such peace to invade at a moment of their weakness, these fears were soon quelled after promises that any agreement made would see a ten mile long demilitarised zone between our two countries. Now with the Taizz Accords signed, from today forward both of our nations have agreed to the desired demilitarised borders, establishing a clear non-aggression pact between us, and that should either side ever face attack from another nation the other would not hesitate to come to the aid of the other. With the signature of the Accords, a new era of peace has been established in our small corner of Arabia, a peace that we hope to maintain for the foreseeable future."
yemen.132.o1: "After decades of conflict, peace has now returned to Yemen"
yemen.133.t: "The South Refuses Peace"
yemen.133.d: "Following the Prime Minister's invitation to southern ambassadors to discuss a new era of peace between our two nations, news has today arrived in the capital that the South has refused our invitation to finally end the hostilities between our two nations. The rejection to attend the meeting in Taizz has stemmed from fears that any such agreement would leave the south in a weakened position and that our government would use this to our advantage and attempt to unify Yemen once more. Despite attempts to explain that these fears have no basis in any reality and that our intentions are to ensure peace for the foreseeable future, the South has refused to discuss the matter further and has now expelled the ambassadors sent to attempt to negotiate peace. With this set back in peace talks, the future of our corner of Arabia continues to be shrouded in conflict and division with no clear end in sight."
yemen.133.o1: "Perhaps peace shall come from the next generation"
yemen.134.t: "North Yemen Seeks to Purchase Socotra"
yemen.134.d: "As talks with the northern ambassadors continue to progress, an interesting proposal has now been suggested by their ambassadors at the negotiation table. In an effort to expand their own trade influence with like-minded capitalist nations, the northern ambassadors now seek to purchase the island of Socotra. Having stated that we would be fairly compensated for the island, promising large sums of money as well as arms and ammunition, the purchase of Socotra would represent to many either our pragmatic outlook or our capitulation to the capitalists of the north. Whilst Socotra is a mostly undeveloped island, its diverse species of flora and fauna has granted us much needed income to our developing tourism sector. Furthermore,  the island’s geographic location lends it a degree of military value, and its strategic ports could prove invaluable in future conflicts. Whilst selling the island may draw immediate benefits for our army and economy, many wonder if the northern government can be trusted to not use this as a staging ground for intervention by either their own or foreign militaries."
yemen.134.o1: "Socotra shall join the north"
yemen.134.o2: "Socotra shall remain with us"
yemen.135.t: "South Agrees to our Purchase of Socotra"
yemen.135.d: "Following a period of tense negotiations southern ambassadors have now responded to our request to purchase the island of Socotra and, to the surprise of many, their ambassadors have now agreed to our requests believing that such a small island is not worth holding onto when our compensation would provide more than enough income to continue to develop their economy for the immediate future. With the signature of this agreement, the island shall be ceded to us with all southern forces now withdrawing from the region to ensure a peaceful transfer. Whilst some are concerned over our decision to grant the south access to our stockpile of weapons, our officials believe that this exchange is more than worth access to the island of Socotra, which, should we develop it properly, could serve as both a major tourist destination and an important strategic naval outpost. Now with negotiations nearly finalized, the government hopes that one more matter can be agreed to with the south that will aid in the development of both our economies."
yemen.135.o1: "We knew they’d see reason"
yemen.136.t: "South Rejects our Proposal"
yemen.136.d: "Following a period of tense negotiations southern ambassadors have now responded to our request to purchase the island of Socotra and, to the surprise of none, their ambassadors have now declined our requests believing that the island remains too important to the economy of the People’s Democratic Republic regardless of how well they would be compensated for our purchase of the island. Despite this rejection our ambassadors have accepted the refusal by the southern ambassadors and have recognized both the economic and historical importance the island has to the south. With this rejection the peace negotiations are expected to continue on as normal with very little harm cause between our two nations relations and whilst some are disappointed by this rejection, believing the island to have been the stepping stone towards further trade with the capitalist world, there is very little we can do to change the minds of the southern ambassadors. Now with only one matter left to discuss with our southern neighbour, many hope that one last deal can be struck before the end of negotiations."
yemen.136.o1: "Extremely disappointing"
yemen.137.t: "The North Seeks Favourable Oil Trade Agreements"
yemen.137.d: "As part of the final stage of peace negotiations between our two governments, the north has now presented the final topic for discussion. Seeking to develop its weakened oil industries, the northern ambassadors have proposed a favorable trade agreement between our two nations with the north being given access to our oil production in exchange for access to their goods and services. This agreement would see both of our economies benefit, with the north finally being able to recover from its loss of vital oil fields now in our possession and our own nation being granted access to much needed consumer goods such as televisions and radios. However, despite the obvious benefits of this deal for both of us, some of our ambassadors remain sceptical about the trustworthiness of these goods believing that they would either be inferior in quality to our own make or modified as a means to spy on our people. The economic benefits of this deal remain clear, however, it is now up to our ambassadors to answer whether or not the northern government can be trusted to sell us goods in exchange for our much needed oil."
yemen.137.o1: "Sell them the oil rights"
yemen.137.o2: "We will not sell to the capitalists!"
yemen.138.t: "South Agrees to Oil for Goods"
yemen.138.d: "With the negotiations between our two governments coming to a close, the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen has now responded to our final request and has agreed to sell us oil in return for access to our consumer goods. The acceptance of this deal has solidified our everlasting friendship, with railroads, highways and airports being opened for the transportation of these materials. Furthermore, the access to this oil will allow our own civilian economy to continue to develop with the people being granted much needed fuel to go about their daily lives and the military being given significant fuel reserves that will allow it to prepare for any potential threats to our nation. With our ambassadors now leaving the border to return to Sana’a, the President has reportedly made plans to meet with President [PDY.Getleader] to demonstrate to both our nations and the world that peace has at last been achieved between our two nations, demonstrating that diplomacy is alive and well in this day and age."
yemen.138.o1: "We will prosper together!"
yemen.139.t: "South Rejects Oil for Goods"
yemen.139.d: "With the negotiations between our two governments coming to a close, the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen has now responded to our final request and has now announced that they will not accept our request to exchange our goods for their oil. This rejection is a significant setback for not only our civilian economy but for the People’s Democratic Republic’s as well. Whilst we had intended to use this oil to develop both our civilian and military sectors, it seems as if this goal is now unachievable as the ambassadors from the People’s Democratic Republic have refused to discuss this matter further. Simply stating that they do not believe our goods will be as superior to their own, as well as the belief that we shall seek to use these goods to spy on their people, the southern government has now ended such promising negotiations on a sour note. Despite this rejection, the President has stated that he shall still meet with President [PDY.Getleader] to demonstrate to our peoples and the world how close diplomacy can bring people together regardless of their ideological differences."
yemen.139.o1: "A poor send off to negotiations"
yemen.140.t: "North Seeks Everlasting Peace"
yemen.140.d: "With talks between our nation and the Republic of Yemen now underway, our ambassadors have immediately been presented with plans to end the decades long conflict between our two nations. The plan itself, aimed at avoiding border conflicts that would trigger another Yemenite war, would establish a twenty-five mile exclusion zone for all military personnel and equipment along our borders and see our countries sign a pact of non-aggression to solidify our commitment to the peace process. While many of our ambassadors see this as a fair deal, some have raised private concerns about whether or not the north can be trusted to uphold their end of the deal regarding the exclusion zone. Some have stated that this would allow the North Yemeni government to easily strike whilst our borders are weakened and quickly advance on our towns and cities overrunning any resistance. However, it does not seem likely that the northern government would suggest an exclusion zone if it would not adhere to itself. With the future of our two nations on the line our ambassadors have now returned to negotiations and come to a decision."
yemen.140.o1: "This will secure peace for generations"
yemen.140.o2: "We cannot trust the north to stay true to this deal"
yemen.141.t: "South Agrees to Everlasting Peace"
yemen.141.d: "With the peace talks between our two nations ongoing the first matter of the negotiations has now been agreed to, with the People’s Democratic Republic now approving of our deal to establish a small twenty-five mile exclusion zone along our borders as well as both of our nations now signing a non-aggression pact. The acceptance of this deal has already been reported back to all major towns and cities across both Yemen’s with our populations celebrating an official end to the hostilities that have plagued our states for decades. Whilst there are some within our government and population that have continued to oppose these talks, believing that it is a betrayal of those who died to secure a united Yemen during the first civil war, this minority has largely been silenced by an over joyous population who can finally see light at the end of a dark tunnel. Now with negotiations continuing, many believe that the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen will continue to cooperate with our government and work towards further beneficial agreements."
yemen.141.o1: "Lasting peace achieved"
yemen.142.t: "South Rejects Rejects Everlasting Peace"
yemen.142.d: "Despite these negotiations beginning on the intentions of codifying peace between our two nations, the ambassadors from the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen have rejected our plans to establish a military exclusion zone along our borders. Whilst hesitant to state their reasoning, due to fears over the talks breaking down, our ambassadors believe that this rejection has stemmed from a lack of trust in our intentions surrounding these peace talks. Whilst our ambassadors continue to state that we would uphold this agreement and ensure that not a single soldier set foot within the exclusion zone, the southern ambassadors have rejected this claim and have promised to maintain their military presence along our borders. Whilst this is a significant setback for peace, with many believing these peace talks now hold no purpose, our two governments have promised to continue to work together to ensure that other agreements can be made that will benefit both our nations."
yemen.142.o1: "Peace was never an option it seems."
yemen.143.t: "President [YEM.Getleader] Meets [PDY.Getleader] at the Border"
yemen.143.d: "With the conclusion of peace negotiations between North and South Yemen and the codification of various agreements between the two states, the time has come for one last show of good faith. This morning at dawn, North Yemeni President [YEM.Getleader] and South Yemeni President [PDY.Getleader] met one another at the border to shake hands in the light of the rising sun, symbolizing a new day for the South Arabian nations. This comes as a disappointment to many who had hoped to see the return of a united Yemen. However, with the exception of a few brief moments, Yemen has existed as at least two states for much of the last century and a half. At this point, the two states have unique cultures, unique traditions, unique governments. This historic recognition of the insurmountable divisions between North and South Yemen may very well be the sentiment required to end the violence and turmoil in South Arabia."
yemen.143.o1: "Give peace a chance"
yemen.144.t: "President [YEM.Getleader] Meets [PDY.Getleader] at the Border"
yemen.144.d: "With the conclusion of peace negotiations between North and South Yemen and the codification of various agreements between the two states, the time has come for one last show of good faith. This morning at dawn, North Yemeni President [YEM.Getleader] and South Yemeni President [PDY.Getleader] met one another at the border to shake hands in the light of the rising sun, symbolizing a new day for the South Arabian nations. This comes as a disappointment to many who had hoped to see the return of a united Yemen. However, with the exception of a few brief moments, Yemen has existed as at least two states for much of the last century and a half. At this point, the two states have unique cultures, unique traditions, unique governments. This historic recognition of the insurmountable divisions between North and South Yemen may very well be the sentiment required to end the violence and turmoil in South Arabia."
yemen.144.o1: "Give peace a chance"
yemen.145.t: "Yemen Seeks Our Investment"
yemen.145.d: "This morning, a delegation from Yemen arrived in Riyadh to negotiate an economic investment into their country. This investment would be primarily composed of the donation of civilian products, though they have also requested that we send them a handful of advisors to oversee and guide the construction of new factories, hospitals, and infrastructure projects in Yemen. Agreeing to such a deal would certainly ingratiate the Yemeni government to us, improving relations between us and giving us a powerful bargaining chip in negotiations. However, some in the Saudi administration feel that Yemen is focusing on expansion in order to overtake us as the premier power of Arabia, and that, as a consequence, we should avoid granting them any further power. Additionally, the government of Yemeni President [YEM.Getleader] doesn’t exactly line up with our own, making them a potential foe in the chaos that the world may soon find itself plunged into."
yemen.145.o1: "Invest in Yemen"
yemen.145.o2: "Refuse to invest in Yemen"
yemen.146.t: "Saudi Arabia Grants Investment"
yemen.146.d: "Our delegation to Saudi Arabia has returned from their mission to Riyadh reporting a success in convincing the Saudis to invest in our country. Soon, shipments full of Saudi goods will begin making their way across the border, and industrial advisors are preparing to be dispatched to various parts of Yemen to aid us in the construction of new hospitals, factories, and infrastructure projects. This deal has brought us and the Saudis closer together, paving the way for future cooperation. However, it is worth noting that Yemen now owes Saudi Arabia a substantial deal of gratitude, something that the world has also taken notice of. It should come as no surprise that our political influence has been somewhat diminished as a result of our reliance on Saudi aid."
yemen.146.o1: "A most generous investment"
yemen.147.t: "Saudi Arabia Refuses to Invest"
yemen.147.d: "Our delegation to Saudi Arabia has returned from their mission to Riyadh reporting a failure in convincing the Saudis to invest in our country. We had hoped that the Saudis would see us as a potential ally and be willing to invest in our future, however, this hope seems to have been misplaced. As it would turn out, the ideological differences between our government and that of Saudi Arabia has caused them to see us as a potential threat rather than a prospective ally, and as such they would rather avoid doing anything to bolster our industrial or military strength. On the bright side, relying on Saudi aid would have made us look weak on the world stage, and so by not following through on the reception of this aid, we maintain greater legitimacy and influence."
yemen.147.o1: "The Saudis are paranoid"
yemen.148.t: "Yemen Offers Rights to Mining Industries"
yemen.148.d: "This morning, a delegation from Yemen arrived in Riyadh to offer to sell us the rights to several mining operations currently being planned in Yemen. Apparently, the Yemeni administration does not believe that their mining technology is advanced enough nor their workers experienced enough to take full advantage of the country’s rich soils. Were we to purchase these mining rights, we would be able to reap the benefit of all the natural resources we find. In return, we would pay a lofty sum to the Yemeni government. Money is, of course, something that the House of Saud has no short supply of, whereas mineral resources are something that we desperately need. That said, bolstering the Yemeni economy in this way may not be the best idea, as there is reason to believe that they have ambitions of usurping our role as the primary power of the Arabian peninsula."
yemen.148.o1: "Purchase the mining rights"
yemen.148.o2: "No thanks, we’ll pass"
yemen.149.t: "Saudi Arabian Corporations Take Over Mining Industry"
yemen.149.d: "Our delegation to Saudi Arabia has returned from their mission to Riyadh reporting that the Saudis have decided to move forward with purchasing the rights to our new mining operations. While it is a shame to see so many valuable resources be extracted from our soil and promptly taken across the border, the compensation that we are receiving from the Saudis will dramatically improve our economy for the foreseeable future. Additionally, this purchase means that a degree of Saudi Arabia’s production capacity is now dependent on resources they extract from our soil, giving us a bargaining chip in negotiations with them in the future. The success of this deal has also done much to further the already prosperous relationship that we already have with Saudi Arabia, making our two countries nearly inseparable on the world stage."
yemen.149.o1: "A worthwhile sacrifice"
yemen.150.t: "Saudi Arabian corporations Refuse Takeover"
yemen.150.d: "Our delegation to Saudi Arabia has returned from their mission to Riyadh reporting that the Saudis have decided not to move forward with purchasing the rights to our new mining operations. This is somewhat of a surprise, as we would have thought that the close relations that our countries enjoy would have motivated them to work with us to achieve a mutually beneficial deal. However, it seems that the Saudis would prefer to maintain their economic dominance over Arabia rather than improve their manufacturing output. On the bright side, this means that, should we develop our mining industry on our own in the future, we will still be able to keep hold of all the resources we extract from our soil."
yemen.150.o1: "An unfortunate surprise"
yemen.151.t: "Border Skirmish Near Taizz"
yemen.151.d: "This morning, our governmental offices began to be flooded by incoming reports detailing the outbreak of violence near the city of Taizz on our border with the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen. While there are conflicting explanations as to what sparked the skirmish, the fighting lasted several hours before military officials on both sides arrived to reign in their troops. The brief encounter has left three of our soldiers dead, as well as five soldiers from the other side of the border. The People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen has yet to issue an official statement on the incident, likely because they too are unsure as to how it started. Ever since Yemen was first divided, we have dreamed of reuniting our people, and this border skirmish is the perfect excuse to do so. Even now, our forces have begun mobilizing to the border, ready to march into the South and crush the putrid communist regime that has oppressed half of our country for so long. The fight will likely not be easy, but no cost is too great; Yemen must be made whole!"
yemen.151.o1: "Soon, all Yemenis will stand united!"
yemen.152.t: "President Announces Reconstruction of the South"
yemen.152.d: "At last, Yemen once more stands united under one flag. Many have taken to the streets in the aftermath of this momentous occasion to celebrate. However, the price of this unification was paid dearly, and much of the South has been rendered a smoldering ruin. Roads have been destroyed, factories levelled, and innumerable homes left as little more than rubble in the sand. With this in mind, President [YEM.Getleader] has unveiled a relief package this morning that aims to quickly and efficiently reconstruct the South. The package does not stop at merely restoring every structure that was destroyed in the fighting, but also plans to increase the region’s development in order to bring it to the same standard as the North. This includes infrastructural advancements, new housing projects, and a plethora of industrial expansions. Provided all goes according to plan, all of Yemen will soon be integrated not just politically, but economically and socially as well."
yemen.152.o1: "We will rebuild it better than ever before"
yemen.153.t: "President Establishes the Arab Coalition"
yemen.153.d: "Today, at a convention of representatives from every democracy in the Arab world, Yemeni President [YEM.Getleader] announced the establishment of the Arab Coalition, an economic and military alliance that all attending countries were formally invited to join. The primary function of the coalition is to preserve democracy in the Arab world against threats from both within and without. To accomplish this, all member states will pledge to defend one another in times of war to the greatest extent that their military can provide. The economic prospects of the coalition serve two purposes. Firstly and most obviously is that by centralizing some aspects of each member state’s economies, all member states can profit and expand. The second and more obscure reason is to prevent economic crises, as few things breed anti-democratic radicalism like depressions and turmoil. By cooperating on an economic level, the young and often fragile democracies of the Arab world can be kept prosperous, and thus safe from some of the worst forms of internal chaos. It remains to be seen if the grand vision proposed by [YEM.Getleader] will bear fruit, but it cannot be denied that this is a momentous occasion in Arab history."
yemen.153.o1: "We must defend democracy in the Middle East!"
yemen.154.t: "Yemen Invites Us to the Arab Coalition"
yemen.154.d: "Representatives from our country recently attended a convention in the Yemeni city of Sana’a, where Yemeni President [YEM.Getleader] announced the establishment of the Arab Coalition, an economic and military alliance that all attending countries were formally invited to join. Only representatives from the democratic regimes of the Arab world were invited, as the primary function of the alliance is to preserve democracy in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to being a military pact, the alliance also includes provisions to establish a system of economic unification similar to the European Union, aiming to bolster and protect the economies of all member states. While all these things seem well and good on paper, some members of our government are concerned that joining this alliance may give Yemen a degree of influence and power over us as the leader of the faction. Additionally, there are concerns that the benefits of economic integration with the coalition’s other member states would be outweighed by the sacrifices to our sovereignty that we would be making by agreeing, as many economic decisions would now require some degree of consent from the other members of the coalition."
yemen.154.o1: "Join the Arab Coalition"
yemen.154.o2: "Refuse the offer"
yemen.155.t: "[From.GetName] Accepts Invitation to the Arab Coalition"
yemen.155.d: "After considerable deliberation, representatives from [From.GetName] have informed us that they will be accepting our invitation to join the Arab Coalition. Following the convention in Sana’a, their leaders were apparently quite impressed by the ambitions and promises of the Arab Coalition to a point where they view it as a necessary institution going forward. [From.GetName]’s joining into the coalition has bolstered the alliance’s military might and political legitimacy, and, once the smaller details have been ratified, the integration of our economies will prove beneficial to both of us. As the Arab Coalition grows, so too does the pressure we exert, making it clear that the Middle East is no longer a playground for imperialist superpowers or repressive dictatorships."
yemen.155.o1: "The democracies of the Arab world must stand together"
yemen.156.t: "[From.GetName] Denies Invitation to the Arab Coalition"
yemen.156.d: "After considerable deliberation, representatives from [From.GetName] have informed us that they will not be accepting our invitation to join the Arab Coalition. Following the convention in Sana’a, their leaders were apparently less than impressed by the lofty goals of the Arab Coalition, and see it as an unnecessary and laughable initiative. According to [From.GetName]’s leadership, a military alliance with us goes completely against their own interests. Likely, this is due to [From.GetName] having their own ambitions for the Arab world, despite the democratic nature of their regime, ambitions that may very well cause them to be our enemy in the future. Furthermore, they have cited our promises of economic integration as a “Faustian bargain” that can only serve to benefit Yemen at the cost of any other member. Needless to say, this aggressive denial of our offer of friendship and protection has driven a wedge between our countries."
yemen.156.o1: "Paranoid traitors"
yemen.157.t: "Arabian Sheikhs Arrive in Yemen"
yemen.157.d: "This morning, Sheiks from all over the Arabian peninsula arrived in Sana’a. Organized by [YEM.Getleader], this convention of tribal leaders has been called to discuss the prospect of Arabian solidarity against both internal and external threats. Whereas previous attempts to achieve unity in the region have been orchestrated from the top down via the actions of heads of states, this convention represents a more decentralized approach, as each Arabian country has many tribes and many Sheiks. While the Sheiks vary quite drastically in their political ideologies, they do all have a common ground to stand on, and thus, despite a handful of impassioned arguments, this convention has already proved more successful at normalizing Middle Eastern relations than any prior event. From this point forward, the Sheiks stand together, ensuring that their influence over their home territories cannot be subverted. This is not to say that there will never be conflict between them, but it does mean that they will henceforth regard an attack on the righteous rule of one Sheik as an attack on the righteous rule of all Sheiks."
yemen.157.o1: "We shall succeed where all others have failed!"
yemen.158.t: "A Meeting with Al Saud"
yemen.158.d: "Last night, Yemeni President Al-Ahmar made a visit to the home of Saudi Arabian King Al-Saud in Riyadh. There have long been ties between the two men, and the recent convening of Arabia’s Sheikhs in Sana’a has certainly put Al-Ahmar into a prestigious position as the host of the event. Thus, last evening’s meeting between Al-Ahmar and Al-Saud was regarded by both parties as a meeting of equals. The two men reportedly got along famously, with Al-Saud referring to Al-Ahmar as “long-lost kin” in an interview this morning. The longer their conversation went on, the more they realized that their ideologies and ambitions were almost perfectly aligned. While the meeting has done little in the realm of creating actual legislation, relations between the two countries have improved dramatically, and it can be all but assured that they will be cooperating closely going forward."
yemen.158.o1: "It is good to have such close friends"
yemen.159.t: "Yemen Seeks Economic Investment"
yemen.159.d: "Following a supremely amicable conversation between Al-Saud and Al-Ahmar, representatives from Yemen have arrived in Riyadh to issue a request that the Saudi state follow through on the agreements that the two leaders reached. The ratification of these agreements would entail broad unifications between the Yemeni and Saudi economies, with each country’s industry partially dedicated to fulfilling the needs of the other’s. Naturally, these economic agreements would be mutually beneficial, easing the burdens of both nations. However, this legislation is not entirely balanced, as Yemen, as the smaller country in this relationship, stands to gain much more from this economic integration than Saudi Arabia does. And, such an arrangement will make us partially dependent on them economically, meaning that if something happens to our notoriously tumultuous neighbor, our own economy will be sent reeling back. Nevertheless, Al-Saud still seems optimistic about the pursuit of close relations with Al-Ahmar’s Yemen, and cooperating with the smaller country could very well serve to protect our interests in the region due to our ideological cohesion."
yemen.159.o1: "We gladly accept"
yemen.159.o2: "This is unbalanced, deny the proposition"
yemen.160.t: "Saudi Arabia Agrees to Economic Investment"
yemen.160.d: "In the wake of wildly successful talks between Yemeni President Al-Ahmar and Saudi Arabian King Al-Saud, representatives from both countries have decided to move forward with codifying the agreements the two leaders reached into law. Under the new legislation, the economies of Saudi Arabia and Yemen will become tightly intertwined, with a portion of each country’s production diverted towards fulfilling the needs of the other’s. As a result, both countries are free to specialize their economies, dramatically reducing strain and increasing efficiencies. Certainly we have now become somewhat dependent on one another, but, while some among our administration question the wisdom in such a move, the risk is certainly worth the reward. After all, our two countries are ideologically cohesive, and there is no reason why we should not collaborate and cooperate to the utmost extent in order to preserve our way of life."
yemen.160.o1: "The tribes of Arabia stand together!"
yemen.161.t: "Saudi Arabia Declines Our Request"
yemen.161.d: "In spite of wildly successful talks between Yemeni President Al-Ahmar and Saudi Arabian King Al-Saud, representatives from both countries have failed to reach consensus on the matter of codifying the two leaders’ economic agreements into law. It seems that no matter what our diplomats proposed, the Saudis argued that the deal was too one sided, that we benefit more than Saudi Arabia ever could from any sort of economic integration. This is a dramatic disappointment that has soured the otherwise exceptional relations between the leadership of Yemen and Saudi Arabia. There is, as with all things, a silver lining to this unfortunate failure. While the close economic cooperation that our representatives had proposed would have been incredibly beneficial to the industries of both countries, we have at least avoided the risk of economic interdependence that would have come alongside such deals. Still, it hurts to see such grand potential go to waste."
yemen.161.o1: "A crushing betrayal"
yemen.162.t: "A Meeting with Sultan Qabooz"
yemen.162.d: "Last evening, Yemeni President Al-Ahmar attended a lovely meeting with Omani Sultan Qabooz at his palace in Muscat. There have long been ties between the two men, and the recent convening of Arabia’s Sheikhs in Sana’a has certainly put Al-Ahmar into a prestigious position as the host of the event. Thus, last evening’s meeting between Al-Ahmar and Qabooz was regarded by both parties as a meeting of equals, an important departure from the often tumultuous relationship between Oman and Yemen. The major takeaway from the evening is that Qabooz and Al-Ahmar have found much to agree upon from an ideological standpoint. Both men see the ancient power structures of the Arabian tribes as sacred institutions that must be defended from those who would strip them of their authority, and to that end believe that, going forward, Oman and Yemen must act as allies towards one another. While the meeting has done little in the realm of creating actual legislation, relations between the two countries have improved dramatically, and it can be all but assured that they will be cooperating closely going forward."
yemen.162.o1: "Enchanting"
yemen.163.t: "Yemen Suggests the Muscat Agreements"
yemen.163.d: "Following a recent meeting between Oman’s prestigious Sultan Qabooz and Yemen’s ascendent President Al-Ahmar, Yemeni representatives have arrived in Muscat to negotiate the ratification of several of the agreements that the two men reached. While various proposals were made during their evening together, the primary ones being debated at this time are the matters of a formalized non-aggression pact between our countries and a degree of mutual military aid. As the agreements stand now, in addition to agreeing to non-aggression, a detachment of Omani defense contractors would be sent to Yemen to aid them in the construction of new military manufacturies and bases. In return, the Yemenis would send several experienced advisors to Oman to train our soldiers to better take advantage of terrain and to teach them more advanced tactics. Overall, this deal seems quite beneficial, however some representatives in our government are unsure of whether it is wise to draw so close to Yemen, despite the strong relationship between Qabooz and Al-Ahmar. After all, Yemen has long been an unstable place, and should their current government collapse again, we could find ourselves drawn into their next conflict."
yemen.163.o1: "Sign the Muscat Agreements"
yemen.163.o2: "Sorry, we’re not interested"
yemen.164.t: "Oman Signs the Muscat Agreements"
yemen.164.d: "Our representatives have returned from their mission to Oman reporting a success in putting some of the agreements made by Omani Sultan Qabooz and Yemeni President Al-Ahmar into law. While many of the two men’s proposals have been shelved for the time being, the agreements currently being put into law are still quite substantial. Under them, the Omani and Yemeni governments will sign a pact of non-aggression, pledging to never go to war with one another. In addition, a detachment of Omani defense contractors will be sent to Yemen to aid us in the construction of new military manufacturies and bases. In return, we will be sending several experienced advisors to Oman to train their soldiers to better take advantage of terrain and to teach them more advanced tactics. These agreements have certainly brought our two countries closer together than they have been in living memory, helping to safeguard the dream of cooperation and stability in the Arabian peninsula."
yemen.164.o1: "An honor to work so closely with our brethren"
yemen.165.t: "Oman Refuses to Sign the Muscat Agreements"
yemen.165.d: "Our representatives have returned from their mission to Oman reporting a failure in their efforts to put some of the agreements made by Omani Sultan Qabooz and Yemeni President Al-Ahmar into law. Several of the agreements the two men had proposed were shelved from the outset, as they were seen as going too far in the direction of reducing the sovereignty of Yemen and Oman in relation to one another. The debates quickly narrowed down to agreements of non-aggression and mutual military aid, but even those proposals soon died on the negotiation floor. As it would appear, the Omani representatives do not feel as though they stand as much to gain as Yemen does, and our officials have yet to hear a counter offer that isn’t grossly weighted in favor of Oman. After much time spent deliberating, the negotiations were officially called off. This sudden change in direction from the extremely positive expectations set by Qabooz and Al-Ahmar’s meeting is extremely disappointing, and has created a major rift between our countries."
yemen.165.o1: "Why would they do this now?"
yemen.166.t: "Generals Draft Plans to Retake the South"
yemen.166.d: "Over the last few weeks, our administration has managed to establish reliable contact with tribal leaders in the South. They have been stripped of almost all of their powers by the Southern regime, however, they still possess a degree of social influence throughout the region, and have offered their cooperation in any endeavor that we undertake that goes towards uniting with the South and incorporating its tribes into our government. Our generals have since taken to drawing up plans to invade the South in the near future. Under these plans, our tribal contacts in the South will orchestrate a coordinated terrorist attack on the Southern capital of Aden, crippling its infrastructure and throwing the Southern forces into disarray. If all goes according to plan, this element of surprise will give our military exactly the advantage it needs to swiftly march across the border and retake the South. The violence will be great, the deaths may be numerous, but Yemen must stand united once more."
yemen.166.o1: "Soon, brothers, we shall stand united!"
yemen.167.t: "Terrorist Attack in Aden City"
yemen.167.d: "In a horrific and unexpected act of violence, North Yemeni sympathizers have detonated several explosive devices across the city of Aden, the capital of the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen. This terrorist attack targeted major roads, hospitals, and government buildings all over the city, causing the deaths of hundreds of South Yemeni citizens, primarily civilians. Aden’s police have detained several suspects, but finding the perpetrators of these monstrous crimes seems to be the least of the South’s worries, as their Northern counterparts appear to have taken this tragedy as an opportunity to invade while the South reels from shock. North Yemeni President [YEM.Getleader] has refused to comment on connections to this terrorist attack, but many feel as though the timing is just too perfect for it not to be sanctioned by the Northern state. Meanwhile, Southern Yemeni President [PDY.Getleader] has openly condemned the North Yemeni state for their actions, whether or not they were involved with the terrorist attack, and has appealed to as many sympathetic powers as it can for support."
yemen.167.o1: "The humanity!"

yemen.168.o1: "All according to plan"
yemen.169.t: "Integrating the Southern Tribes"
yemen.169.d: "In the wake of our recent reclamation of the South and the destruction of its putrid communist regime, several of the region's tribes have regained power at the local level that had been stripped from them by the Southern administration. However, they have not yet been integrated into the day to day functioning of our government. In an address from President [YEM.Getleader], the time has come to rectify this. The Southern tribes are still Yemeni tribes, and, despite their failure to stand up to the People’s Democratic Republic, they still deserve a spot on our tribal council. Beginning today, we will begin the process of combing through each and every tribe in the region and welcoming them into our administration. With the addition of these various Sheikhs, the South will be able to be governed much more efficiently, increasing our ability to conscript new men, and solidifying our political control."
yemen.169.o1: "At last, Yemen’s tribes stand united!"
yemen.170.t: "Yemen Asks for Equipment"
yemen.170.d: "A delegation from Yemen arrived in Ottawa today to request that we donate some of our military supplies to them. This donation would consist of a few hundred artillery pieces and light tanks, as well as several crates of rifles and ammunition. Such a donation is certainly within our capacity to grant to the Yemenis, and would represent only a minor setback in our production lines. It would also serve to strengthen the bonds that Canada recently established with Yemen, and help them to outfit their army. Needless to say, having the gratitude of Yemen’s rapidly expanding military could certainly help us to further our own interests in the Middle East. Of course, there are no guarantees that Yemen will continue their efforts to draw closer to Canada, and should that come to pass, we could be unknowingly arming our future opponent. And with the ever-rising tensions of the world, every gun counts for something, and so it might be beneficial to hang on to all the supplies we produce."
yemen.170.o1: "Grant Yemen’s request"
yemen.170.o2: "We need the equipment"
yemen.171.t: "Canada Agrees to Send Weaponry"
yemen.171.d: "We have received word from our delegation to Ottawa that Canada has granted our request for a donation of military munitions. Soon, our ports will be flooded by hundreds of Canadian tanks and artillery pieces, as well as over two thousand rifles. These supplies are expected to find their way into the hands of our armed forces within the week, with the exception of a handful of the light tanks, which will instead be sent to the military’s research and development sector to be reverse engineered. With any luck, this will result in useful data that our own tank manufacturers can use to speed up the development of more advanced domestic designs. While generous, this donation is, admittedly, not much. It will help, there’s no doubt about that, but a few deliveries of munitions are hardly a revolutionary change for Yemen’s armed forces. Instead, the primary function of this donation is as a sign of good faith, an understanding that Canada is willing to be a compassionate ally and help fulfill the needs of Yemen."
yemen.171.o1: "We value our Canadian friends"
yemen.172.t: "Canada Refuses Arms Shipments"
yemen.172.d: "We have received word from our delegation to Ottawa that the Canadian government has unfortunately declined our request for an arms donation. According to Canadian representatives, while they wish they could help us, Canada’s military needs every gun they can get right now, considering the rapidly growing tensions of the world. Members of our own government are somewhat skeptical of this excuse, feeling that what it really comes down to is that Canada doesn’t see Yemen as a valuable ally. After all, the requested donation was quite small, and was mainly asked for as a show of good faith. Being refused this donation really won’t set Yemen’s industry back too far, but it has set back Yemeni-Canadian relations somewhat, with many in Yemen having lost any trust in Canada as a valuable ally."
yemen.172.o1: "Cheapskates"
yemen.173.t: "Yemeni Selegates Offer Favourable Trade Agreements"
yemen.173.d: "A delegation from Yemen arrived in Ottawa this morning to discuss a slew of new trade agreements between our countries. Under these new deals, efforts would be made to ensure the fast and efficient exchange of our currencies, and tariffs would be banned on most goods travelling between Canada and Yemen. Furthermore, when it comes to corporate affairs, Canadian firms would be granted a privileged status in Yemen, and Yemeni firms would be granted a likewise status in Canada. While these reforms would undoubtedly increase trade between our countries and prove quite profitable for many of our larger firms, the fact of the matter is that Canada’s economy dwarfs that of Yemen many times over, meaning that the Yemenis gain a disproportionate advantage under the terms of these trade agreements. Some of our officials believe that this fact alone is enough to refuse the deal on principle, while others say we should at least try and make some sort of counter-offer that tips the scale more in our favor. That said, this deal could easily lead to Yemen developing an economic dependence on Canada sometime down the line, which could very well make this unbalanced agreement worth it."
yemen.173.o1: "Sign the deal"
yemen.173.o2: "Refuse on principle"
yemen.174.t: "Canada Agrees to Trade Agreements"
yemen.174.d: "Our delegation to Canada has returned today reporting success in acquiring a comprehensive list of trade agreements with the Canadian government. From this point forward, Yemen and Canada will no longer be able to levy tariffs on one another’s goods, and measures have been made to make our currencies more easily exchangeable. In addition, Canadian companies now have a privileged status in our lands, and ours have a likewise privilege in theirs. The end result of these agreements should be an increased volume and profitability of trade between our two countries, which will doubtlessly result in substantial economic growth. Truthfully, given that Canada is such a major exporter, these deals disproportionately benefit us at the moment. That said, these agreements do mean that the door is open for Canadian corporations to gain outsized influence over our country if we aren’t careful, and our currency is now highly dependent on theirs. That said, all projections show our profits rising considerably over the near future, and these deals have certainly helped us to align ourselves with the Canadians."
yemen.174.o1: "Wonderful"
yemen.175.t: "Canada Declines our Trade Agreements"
yemen.175.d: "Our delegation to Canada has returned today reporting a failure to achieve any sort of consensus regarding major trade agreements with the Canadian government. During the last few days of negotiations, delegates from both countries simply could not work out a deal that was deemed acceptable by both parties, with the Canadians claiming that our initial offer disproportionately benefited Yemen by a huge margin, and that, as a major power, they have no reason to accept such a thing. Meanwhile, their counter-offers have been utterly insulting, as they would have effectively turned Yemen into a borderline vassal state for corporate interests. In fact, even our initial proposal would have put us at risk of falling victim to outsized influence of Canadian corporations in the long run, so, while we will see neither the close diplomatic ties nor the economic boom that the ratification of these trade agreements would have brought about, the collapse of negotiations isn’t entirely negative."

yemen.176.t: "Yemeni Delegates Propose Stricter Anti-Piracy Exercises"
yemen.176.d: "A delegation from Yemen arrived today to propose a slew of joint anti-piracy operations in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, sea zones that have long been infamous for the prevalence of pirates within their waters. Proximity to the Suez Canal has meant that there has always been a high volume of cargo ships for pirates to prey on, and the decline of globalized capitalism over the last several decades has meant that there are few major powers with a vested interest in preventing piracy south of the Suez. Still, these pirates, left unchecked, have certainly become a nuisance to us and our neighbors. If we accept Yemen’s offer, we could do some real damage to piracy rates in our region, making trade and travel safer. Doing so would also give us a chance to experiment with some new naval maneuvers that our admirals have been discussing as of late. Of course, there is an up front cost to embarking on these exercises with Yemen. Sending out the navy is never cheap, and our ships run the risk of being damaged in encounters with pirates, which would certainly invoke rather costly repairs."
yemen.176.o1: "We will crush the pirates with Yemen"
yemen.176.o2: "Yemen can handle this on their own"
yemen.177.t: "Ethiopia Agrees to Stricter Anti-Piracy Raids"
yemen.177.d: "Our delegation has returned from Ethiopia reporting that the Ethiopian government has decided to join us for a series of cooperative anti-piracy raids in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Over the next several weeks, Yemen and Ethiopia’s navies will work in tandem to hunt down and eliminate pirates operating in the region. These exercises will help to ensure the safe conducting of trade and travel south of the Suez Canal, which will certainly prove beneficial to our economy. Additionally, the exercises will give our navy the chance to experiment with some new maneuvers that our admirals have proposed, which should, hopefully, help speed along the development of our own naval warfare doctrine, something that will assuredly come in handy in future armed conflicts. Finally, this cooperative effort between Yemen and Ethiopia has helped to establish positive diplomatic relations between our countries, and, while we may not always see eye to eye on every issue, a sense of trust has begun to grow between us."
yemen.177.o1: "Together we will protect our seas"
yemen.178.t: "Ethiopia Declines Request for Stricter Anti-Piracy Raids"
yemen.178.d: "Our delegation has returned from Ethiopia reporting that Ethiopian officials have ultimately decided against working with us on a series of anti-piracy raids in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. We had hoped that the Ethiopian government would be eager to join us in this venture, given that piracy is a costly hamper on both of our nations, but it would seem that Ethiopia simply cannot risk damage to their fleets right now, nor do they feel that the long term benefits of being rid of these pirates is worth the current cost of fuel, staffing, and maintenance. There is, of course, an additional implied justification for their hesitancy to work with us; the Ethiopian government does not trust Yemen, and is incredibly skeptical of [YEM.Getleader]’s intentions for proposing these raids. Needless to say, this refusal to work with us has severely damaged diplomatic relations between Yemen and Ethiopia, and, while there is still a chance for future cooperation, it may take time for cooler heads to prevail."
yemen.178.o1: "Cowards"
yemen.179.t: "Yemeni Delegates Propose Mining Agreements"
yemen.179.d: "Delegates from Yemen arrived in Canberra this morning to propose a deal regarding mining technology. They aren’t looking for advisors, nor are they requesting that we send contractors to help them expand their mining operations. Instead, the Yemenis are merely requesting access to various research documents and blueprints so that they can modernize and expand their mining operations themselves. These documents are mostly classified, either by government officials or by industry executives, but the Yemenis are offering quite substantial compensation for the privilege, and the Yemeni payments would benefit our country for years to come. That said, giving Yemen access to Australian mining technology could result in Yemen competing with us on the world resource market, which could prove quite painful for our bottom line. There’s also the risk of the technology leaking, potentially giving an advantage to those who would see us harm."
yemen.179.o1: "Sell the technology to Yemen"
yemen.179.o2: "We can’t risk it"
yemen.180.t: "Australia Agrees to Mining Contracts"
yemen.180.d: "Our delegation to Australia has returned having successfully negotiated a contract for us to purchase the rights to a handful of advanced mining technologies. This purchase has turned several confidential blueprints and research documents over to our possession. This purchase wasn’t cheap, however, and we expect to be making payments to the Australians for years to come. Nevertheless, this deal will ensure that our budding mining industry advances at a faster pace, helping us to harness all the wealth that our soil can provide. This deal has also established a precedent of positive diplomatic relations with Australia, bringing our countries closer together despite our frequent ideological differences."
yemen.180.o1: "A toast to our Australian friends!"
yemen.181.t: "Australia Refuses New Mining Contracts"
yemen.181.d: "Our delegation to Australia has returned from their trip to Canberra reporting a failure to secure a deal that would grant us access to advanced Australian mining technologies. We had hoped that they would agree to the deal, as access to these technologies would have dramatically increased the speed at which our own budding mining industry could develop. Our offer in exchange was a commitment to provide them with fairly substantial monthly payments for the next few years, but they seem to have judged that these payments alone were not enough. They seem to fear that we may outcompete them in world resource markets if we are assisted in developing our mining capabilities, and would prefer to prevent us from cutting into their bottom line. Additionally, they have stated that they do not want to risk the technology leaking to “potential enemies,” an excuse that hardly inspires faith that Australia doesn’t see Yemen as one such potential enemy."
yemen.181.o1: "Bastards!"
yemen.182.t: "Yemen Seeks Electronic Investment"
yemen.182.d: "A delegation from Yemen arrived in Delhi this morning to negotiate the purchase of a substantial shipment of electronic products that we had initially planned on allocating to our governmental operations. However, the Yemenis are offering us a considerable amount of money for this shipment, and our industry should be able to replace the spent resources quite quickly. Selling these electronic goods to the Yemenis is guaranteed to speed up the technological development of their country, something that would assuredly ingratiate them to us. However, it’s also possible that we could be unknowingly providing resources to a potential enemy, and providing Yemen with so many advanced goods risks a leak of confidential technology that could prove dangerous in the wrong hands. Despite all this, the payment plans offered by the Yemenis would certainly bolster our economy for years to come, and so this deal may very well be worth the risks."
yemen.182.o1: "Sell the goods to Yemen"
yemen.182.o2: "We’re not interested"
yemen.183.t: "India Agrees to Ship Electronics"
yemen.183.d: "Our delegation to India has returned having successfully negotiated a deal for Yemen to purchase a few large shipments of electronic goods. In recent decades, India has become one of the world’s most prolific manufacturers of electronic goods, and so their products are a natural place to start when it comes to advancing our own electronics industry. By reverse engineering these products, we can learn to create our own advanced electronics, and some of the equipment we’ve purchased can be retrofitted into our current electronics manufacturing plants to make them more efficient. All in all, this deal, while quite expensive for us, will pay off nicely in due time, as it is bound to give the Yemeni electronics industry exactly the boost it needs, and, as an added bonus, has established a precedent of mutually beneficial cooperation with India, which could very well benefit us in the future."
yemen.183.o1: "Perfect"
yemen.184.t: "India Declines Request for Electronic Shipments"
yemen.184.d: "Our delegation to India has returned having failed to negotiate a deal for Yemen to purchase some large shipments of electronic goods. In recent decades, India has become one of the world’s most prolific manufacturers of electronic goods, and so their products are a natural place to start when it comes to advancing our own electronics industry. Unfortunately, the shipments of electronics that we had been interested in buying were already allocated towards Indian governmental operations, and, according to the Indian representatives, this domestic demand was more important than any amount of money that Yemen could realistically offer them. Buying from India’s civilian markets is somewhat problematic, so this means that getting any sort of boost from Indian technology is likely off the table for the foreseeable future, forcing us to modernize Yemen’s technology industry on our own. Advancements will be made, they’ll just take longer than they would have with the aid of Indian products."
yemen.184.o1: "The Indians are too short-sighted"
yemen.185.t: "Yemen Offers Port Access"
yemen.185.d: "A delegation from Yemen arrived in Moscow this morning to offer Russia access to Yemen’s strategic ports. The fascinating part of this offer is that the Yemenis are currently asking nothing from us in return, merely offering us free access, should we desire it. This is an incredibly generous offer, given the important strategic position of Yemen in the Middle East. Giving our ships a place to dock in the region will drastically improve our ability to spread our influence throughout Africa and the Middle East. However, the fact that the Yemenis aren’t asking for anything in return has invoked suspicion from Russia’s officials, who feel that this good simply must be too good to be true. Likely, this move has been made by the Yemenis in order to strengthen diplomatic relations between our countries, but there are, hypothetically, more insidious reasons for their offer. For instance, they would be able to sabotage Russian ships while they are docked, or they could study and steal the designs of our ships to strengthen their own naval power. These ideas are mostly far-fetched and unlikely, but they remain as potential reasons to refuse Yemen’s offer."
yemen.185.o1: "We accept this incredibly generous offer"
yemen.185.o2: "We don’t trust Yemen"
yemen.186.t: "Russia Accepts Port Access"
yemen.186.d: "Our delegation to Moscow has returned reporting that the Russians have accepted our offer to grant them access to our ports. We asked for nothing in return, so it would frankly be quite strange for the Russians to refuse this deal, but it is something worth celebrating nonetheless. Russia is far and away the most prominent of the post-Soviet states that now populate Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and so ingratiating ourselves to them can only prove beneficial to Yemen. Were there ever to be a conflict between Russia and Yemen, it likely would have spawned from Russia seeking access to Yemen’s ports, and so, by simply giving them access now, war is much less likely, and our officials remain on positive terms with one another. Russian gratitude will also make it much easier for us to ask favors from them in the future, and has laid the groundwork for future cooperation between our countries."
yemen.186.o1: "As expected"
yemen.187.t: "Russia Declines Port Access"
yemen.187.d: "Our delegation to Moscow has returned reporting that the Russians have rejected our offer to grant them access to our ports. This is quite the surprising turn of events, given that we weren’t even asking them for anything in return for the privilege. Given Yemen’s strategic positioning in the Middle East, the assumption had been that the Russians would be overjoyed to have access to our ports so that they could better spread their influence throughout Africa and the Middle East. However, it would seem that the Russian government trusts neither the safety of Yemen’s ports nor the benevolence of our intentions. This is an unfortunate outcome, as we had hoped that our generous offer would help to establish positive diplomatic ties between Yemen and Russia. However, it’s clear that the Russians do not see us as a potential ally in the region, and would rather continue on without any sort of support from us."
yemen.187.o1: "Paranoid idiots"
yemen.188.t: "Yemeni Delegates Request Plane Modules"
yemen.188.d: "A delegation from Yemen has once more arrived in Moscow, this time to negotiate the purchase of several of our fighter plane modules. Apparently, Yemen is working to modernize its air force, and would like a shipment of Russian modules for them to study and repurpose to suit their needs, and they’re willing to pay us quite handsomely for the honor. Naturally, many of our representatives are ready to immediately agree to this deal. After all, Yemen just recently gave us access to their naval bases, which has dramatically increased our ability to conduct naval operations in the Middle East. Needless to say, Russia certainly owes Yemen, since these docking rights were given for free. However, others within our government are less convinced by Yemen’s supposed dedication to positive relations with us, as they also have a degree of political ties to other countries that we’re not on as good of terms with. Furthermore, selling these aircraft modules could create the possibility of leaks, handing the schematics of our latest and greatest aircraft to our enemies. This fact alone could outweigh the money Yemen is offering us and the debt that we owe them for their generous gift of basing rights."
yemen.188.o1: "Sell the modules"
yemen.188.o2: "We don’t trust Yemen enough"
yemen.189.t: "Russia Agrees to Send Modern Plane Modules"
yemen.189.d: "Our delegation to Moscow has returned, reporting a success in negotiating a purchase of Russian aircraft modules. By studying these modules, Yemen will be able to manufacture better planes of its own, dramatically increasing our ability to fight in aerial engagements against larger powers. In return for these advanced modules, Yemen will be paying the Russian government in sizable quantities of money and finished goods for the next few years. Were it not for our earlier granting of naval bases to the Russians, it’s likely that this deal would not have come to pass. With this deal secured, it’s clear that we have earned the trust and favor of the Russians, and, should the tensions in the world reach their boiling point, a military alliance between Yemen and Russia seems to be a genuine potentiality."
yemen.189.o1: "These will be put to good use"
yemen.190.t: "Russia Refuses to Send Modern Plane Modules"
yemen.190.d: "Our delegation to Moscow has returned, reporting a failure to negotiate a purchase of Russian aircraft modules. Had the deal been accepted, Yemen would have gained access to a wealth of advanced aircraft modules, which could be reverse engineered to accelerate research on our own aircraft models. We had hoped that, following our generous granting of docking rights to the Russians, that they would be more willing to go forward with more mutual trade deals like this one, where Yemen would have provided large amounts of money in exchange for the Russian aircraft modules. However, it would appear that the Russians were merely taking advantage of Yemen’s generosity, and have no interest in doing anything to actually help us. Needless to say, relations between Yemen and Russia have suffered greatly as a result of this failed deal. Clearly, the Russians see us as a tool rather than an ally, and Yemen shall not stand for such humiliation."
yemen.190.o1: "Selfish bastards"
yemen.191.t: "[Root.GetYear] Presidential Election"
yemen.191.d: "Exactly one year ago today, President Akwa announced that for the first time in recent history free and fair elections will be held to determine the future of the nation. Now after a year of campaigning, election day has finally arrived with polling revealing a clear challenger to the presidency of Abdullah al-Akwa. The National Coalition, led by Ahmed Daghr, has steadily been growing in its support across the nation offering a clear alternative to Al-Islah. Daghr hopes to appeal to the nation through combining elements of his own centrist economic policy with the political promises made by Khaled Bahah in the Jasmine Coalition. Whilst a controversial decision Daghr remains confident that his populist appeal will be able to convince the population that Yemen does not have to remain loyal to Al-Islah despite their newfound love for democracy. With a clear challenger to his presidency appearing, al-Akwa hopes that the recent surge in support for the Al-Islah government shall be enough to maintain his mandate and allow for his government to continue their efforts in the reconstruction of the nation. Now, with all the ballots counted and over eighty per cent of the nation turning out to vote, the people have decided that…"

yemen.192.t: "[Root.GetYear] Presidential Elections"
yemen.192.d: "Today, four years after the previous election, the nation now once again heads to the ballot box to determine the future of the nation. Much like the previous elections, two parties have maintained a steady hold over the hearts of the nation and it seems likely that either Al-Islah shall be granted another term or, in an upset to President Akwa, the National Coalition will be able to turn enough voters away from Al-Islah and finally end Al-Islah’s hegemony over politics. Whilst the President remains confident that the reforms to the nation will be enough to ensure his majority within parliament, the National Coalition has used this complacency to begin new attacks against the government promoting their cause as a crusade for democracy. Much like four years ago Daghr has continued his populist rhetoric calling on all Yemeni citizens to vote for a new future, a future where the supposed elite are no longer in control of the government. With months of campaigning now ending, and the ballots now closed, the people for the second time in recent history have now cast their ballots and have elected…"

yemen.193.d: "Today, four years after the previous election, the nation now once again heads to the ballot box to determine the future of the nation. Much like the previous elections, two parties have maintained a steady hold over the hearts of the nation and it seems likely that either the National Coalition shall solidify its position as the second party of Yemen or, in a political upset, Al-Islah shall return from the opposition bench and restore itself as the true party of Yemen. With President Daghr continuing his populist rhetoric labelling himself as a man of the people, former President Awka has now attempted to counter this rhetoric and win back voters who had abandoned Al-Islah for the National Coalition. Having highlighted the lack of actual political reform under the new government, many have been swayed by the former president switching their allegiance once again to the true party of Yemen. Now with months of campaigning now ending, and the ballots now closed, the people for the second time in recent history have now cast their ballots and have elected…"

yemen.194.d: "Today the President has announced that new elections will be held to reveal the people’s continued support for the Al-Islah government. With government polling revealing public support at eighty percent it is expected that President Qahtan shall maintain his position and continue as Yemen's President. Now after weeks of campaigning the results have been totalled and it has been announced that, to the surprise of none, President Qahtan has maintained his position after having received over eighty-five percent of the vote. Once again opponents to the government have raised concerns over the legitimacy of the election, citing frequent abuse of power through voter suppression and continued abuses of police power at the ballot. However, despite calls for electoral reform from all corners of the opposition the government has responded to these demands by beginning to crackdown on these protestors who will no doubt reappear at the next election in seven years time. With the dominance of Al-Islah being once again reinforced by the people, President Qahtan has now been granted again a supermajority to carry out the manifesto of his party."

An official announcement from the royal palace this morning has confirmed what many have feared; our brilliant King Muadh I has died. While the details have been largely kept from the public, it’s no secret that the dearly departed king’s health had been declining for some time now, no doubt at least partially due to his advanced age. He passed away late last night of natural causes, surrounded by close friends and family. The life of Muadh I was an exceptional one. After escaping into exile following the horrific violence of the civil war in 1966, Muadh I spent much of his life living in the royal courts of Saudi Arabia, learning the arts of statecraft and leadership. It should come as no surprise then, that when he returned to his rightful throne he quickly became the exact guiding hand that Yemen needed most. His reign brought stability to our nation, and set us on a path towards a greatness never seen by any previous Yemeni state. His royal highness will be missed greatly by his loyal subjects, and will be remembered forever for his many contributions to our proud nation."

Initially, the Regent’s cabinet had expected for the crown prince, Ageel bin Muhammad al-Badr, to be invited home and reclaim his throne. However, unexpectedly, the Regent has instead chosen to invite the cousin of the heir apparent who has spent the majority of his life in Saudi Arabia establishing himself as a prominent figure within royal society. Unlike his cousin, who has lived in exile in London for the majority of his life, Muadh Hamid al-Din remains a strong contender for the throne and has now accepted the invitation handed to him by Regent Subaihi. Whilst many have questioned the motives of altering the line of succession, the Regent has defended his actions stating that in order for the monarch to be respected by the people they must be accustomed to the royal way of life, rather than having abandoned it for comfort in the United Kingdom. With the crown prince and his family now expected to arrive in Yemen by the end of the week, the nation waits eagerly for the restoration of the monarchy and the coronation of Muadh the First."

The delegation has laid out a treaty which offers both military and naval access to Yemen, it seems they wish to develop closer ties to us in order to advance their nation in the world. More hawkish and interventionist politicians strongly encourage that we accept the treaty, it can’t hurt to expand our global influence after all. More isolationist voices have however voiced their opposition to the treaty, Yemen has been the target of various wars over the years and many do not wish to get involved in these foreign conflicts. The treaty may also cause Yemen to develop a dependence on us, draining valuable resources we could be using for ourselves. But, if we do wish to get back on the stage of international politics, this could be an excellent opportunity to begin to take back our influence on the global stage."

Those in support of the opening of Yemen to the outside world are elated to hear that the Americans accepted the offer, hailing it as the first step towards the success of Yemen in international politics. More conservative isolationists have voiced their opposition to the move however, believing that it will slowly make Yemen dependent on the Americans, depriving us of our independence. It is expected that this will only be the first of many moves towards courting the Americans, and hopefully to bring prosperity to Yemen."

While the move puzzles many, as it seemed that it could only benefit the Americans with our strategically vital location close to the Red Sea and Suez Canal, the American diplomats have stated that at the present moment the Republic is focused more on internal matters and does not wish to involve itself once more in the affairs of the Middle East. More isolationist voices are seemingly happy to hear the rejection, believing that a bullet was dodged that could have hurt Yemen’s sovereignty with some theorising that the American Republic would use their military access to sway our politics to favour American interests in the region. Despite this rejection, the President hopes that our ambassadors will continue to attempt to foster new relations with the Americans, and cement ourselves as a strong nation on the international stage."

Yemen is rich with oil and other fuel resources, gaining access to their oil supply could be an excellent boon towards our economy as well as rebuilding our military. This deal would allow American companies to have full access to oil fields, a very enticing opportunity to many, and one which many investors are eager to take advantage of. Some investors have warned caution however, as tying ourselves too closely to the Yemeni economy could have disastrous consequences if we begin to rely on their oil, and could possibly promote a single resource economy in Yemen. The deal would however boost the economy of Yemen and possibly create a strong economic ally for the future, as well as expand our sphere of global influence. Plus, it will surely garner approval with investors and cause a boost to our economy."

With our oil fields now recognized as a valuable resource, we will hopefully become recognized on the world stage, allowing us to prosper as an American ally.Some do worry however that if the Americans begin to take control of our oil fields, we will become nothing more than corporate puppets, dancing to the whim of foreign businessmen, but surely these are just superstitions of out of date politicians."

American investors have refused to take the risk of possibly tying themselves to us, it seems we’ll have to start looking elsewhere for investments into our oil fields. This has been a loss for those who wished to tie ourselves to the Americans, although it has been a victory for isolationists who opposed outside influence in our oil fields. At the very least perhaps we have avoided becoming corporate puppets, and our oil remains our own. Surely however other powers may take an interest in Yemeni oil, and perhaps then we shall find our ticket onto the world stage."

 JASMINE_COUNCIL_DESC: "As an embodiment of the years of pent up anger and resentment towards the Al-Islah government, the Jasmine Council has become a clear force to be reckoned with since the collapse of Mohammad Qahtan’s government. Whilst only officially banding together at the beginning of the collapse of the government, the history of resistance towards the Al-Islah government began as early as 1993 when Najeeb Qahtan al-Sha’abi, the now open leader of the Yemeni National Front, stood as a candidate for the presidency aiming to defy the authoritarian policies of General Secretary Abdul Fattah Ismail and former North Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Whilst unsuccessful, achieving less than three per cent of the vote, Sha’abi’s bid for the presidency eventually inspired Khaled Bahah to stand against the government in 2007 when he demanded the establishment of a third political force in parliament leading to the first constitutional amendment and the establishment of the National Coalition. Two years later, hoping to pressure the government to further the constitutional amendments, Tawakkol Karman rallied the population to her side hoping to bring an end to the tyranny of Al-Islah and formed the Popular Revolution movement in the hopes of ending decades of dictatorship. Now with the forces of democracy rallied together, and having successfully placed aside their political differences until the war is won and elections can finally be called, the Jasmine Council begins its march against the forces of tyranny hoping to light the flame of democracy in Yemen’s small corner of Arabia."
 
 SHABI_DESC: "As the son of former President of the People's Republic of South Yemen, Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi, life has always remained difficult for Najeeb Qahtan al-Sha’abi. Having remained under constant surveillance and investigation until his fathers death in 1981, Sha’abi was banned from political activity emerging once in 1982 at the behest of the Supreme People’s Council to denounce his father. However, his political exile did not last and by reunification in 1990, the presidential council repealed his ban. With newfound freedom, Sha’abi established the Yemeni National Front after briefly considering joining the General People’s Congress. By 1992, Sha’abi ran in the presidential elections, however, was unable to gain significant support from the populace, achieving only three per cent of the vote. Likewise, the 1993 parliamentary elections heralded similar results with the YNF achieving two percent of the vote. On the outbreak of the civil war, Sha’abi allied himself with the north and worked closely with Al-Islah eventually being considered as a contender for legal opposition in the new Yemeni constitution. However, Sha'abi's demands for further democratization and leniency towards YSP representatives were not well received, and shattering his hopes, the Al-Islah government outlawed his party. Forced to stand as an independent candidate, Sha’abi has remained defiant towards Al-Islah demanding further change to the constitution to facilitate the transition towards true democracy. With the Jasmine Council’s successful revolution, Sha’abi can now implement his desired reforms and follow in the footsteps of his father radically transforming the political structure of Yemen to suit his needs."

 BEIDH_DESC: "Ali Salem al Beidh's political career was baptized in fire, during the Radfan Uprising where he served in the ranks of the National Liberation Front quickly earning a name for himself within the organization. With independence secured for the south, al-Beidh was soon appointed as the General Secretary of the Hadhramaut Provincial Committee, where he was admitted into the Yemeni Socialist Party national central committee as a candidate. By 1975 he was selected as a full member and granted the position of Deputy Minister for School Education and Vocational Training. Al-Beidh’s loyalty was soon after tested during the 1986 civil war which saw him rise to the position of Vice-President, a position he maintained until the reunification of Yemen. Following the assassination of Abdul Fattah Ismail by northern-backed Islamists, al-Beidh was quickly inaugurated as the new President. It is here that he quickly learnt the harsh realities of leadership, as the civil war turned into a decade-long conflict that ultimately led to the collapse of the south. Having retreated to the Omani border, al-Beidh has spent the last few years gathering the strength of the YSP leading an effective guerilla campaign against the north. With opportunity now presenting itself, the General Secretary hopes to finally accomplish what the Dhofar Proclamation set out to achieve; the restoration of the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen."
