 SOV_workers_in_the_dissident_republics:0 "Workers in the Dissident Republics"

 SOV_allies_in_the_republics:0 "Allies in the Republics"
 SOV_allies_in_the_republics_desc:0 "Due to his reformist agenda, Gorbachev has many allies in the dissident republics from the Baltics to Central Asia. These alliances could be utilised to strengthen our position and the stability of our Union."

 SOV_root_out_corruption_desc:0 "Gorbachev promised that corruption within the government would be wiped out in little time after his rise to power. Now is the time to fulfill that promise and rid our great nation of its internal enemies."

 SOV_more_power_to_trade_unions:0 "More Power to Trade Unions"
 SOV_more_power_to_trade_unions_desc:0 "Independent trade unions are still a long way off and perhaps will never come to fruition in the USSR. However, we should give them more power and freedom, rather than being totally controlled by the government."

 SOV_individuality_in_work:0 "Individuality in Work"
 SOV_individuality_in_work_desc:0 "The collectivised Soviet economy has decreased worker participation and motivation, as most are guaranteed employment whether they work hard or not. Now the Soviet people should be rewarded for their labour, as long as they put in the effort required."
 SOV_embrace_the_state:0 "Embrace the State"
 SOV_embrace_the_state_desc:0 "Reforms were necessary in the Soviet Union, but those calling for a new revolution and even the dissolution of the Union are madmen. Gorbachev will embrace the state and all its benefits."

 SOV_gorbachevs_kgb_desc:0 "The KGB has been a known opponent of Gorbachev, both in his early political days and now as Chairman. However, by sidelining radical reformists and revolutionaries, it is possible that he could restore their trust in the leadership."

 SOV_eurasian_nationalist:0 "Eurasian Nationalist"

 SOV_crackdown_in_the_baltics:0 "Crackdown in the Baltics"
 SOV_crackdown_in_the_baltics_desc:0 "The Baltic Republics are less than joyous upon hearing about Chairman Rutskoy's Eurasian sympathies. Perhaps they need a lesson..."

 SOV_ease_separatist_tensions:0 "Ease Separatist Tensions"

 SOV_closed_society:0 "Closed Society"
 SOV_closed_society_desc:0 "A more open society in recent years has led to destabilisation in the Soviet Union and cultures drifting in from around the world. We should close our great society from outside influences and protect the nation's history."

 SOV_strengthen_the_chairman:0 "Strengthen the Chairman"
 SOV_strengthen_the_chairman_desc:0 "While a strongman, Yazov did hand over some powers to the Politburo and slightly weaken his position. In hindsight this was a terrible move, as now our new Chairman must restore his lost power."
 SOV_economic_recovery_plan:0 "Economic Recovery Plan"
 SOV_economic_recovery_plan_desc:0 "The economic situation in the Soviet Union is a looming disaster that many are unwilling to admit. While recovering from the political fallout from Yazov's assassination, we must not forget that the Soviet economy will collapse if something doesn't happen."

 SOV_end_the_trade_unions_desc:0 "Putin's predecessor allowed some trade unions to flourish, but with almost complete state control. However they have hindered economic growth and influenced the Politburo far too much. The trade unions must end."

 USA_the_industrial_issue_desc:0 "Our economic situation is one of the poorest in the former United States, as the South has never been a major center for industry and development. This issue must be solved as soon as possible if we are to overcome other grievances."
 USA_low_company_tax:0 "Low Company Tax"
 USA_low_company_tax_desc:0 "Lowering taxes on corporations is the way forward. With lower taxes, corporations can pursue economic profits without interference from the state, and the economy can achieve its full potential without regulations from any federal body."
 USA_support_companies:0 "Support Companies"
 USA_support_companies_desc:0 "Corporations need all the support they can get, and what better source of that support than the government? Companies and corporations built old America, and with the collapse of the democratic welfare states of Europe, it is clear that the government must step away as the supreme economic body. Business is business!"
 USA_a_middle_ground:0 "A Middle Ground"
 USA_a_middle_ground_desc:0 "The current tax rate placed on corporations should be enforced. Centrist economics, not radicalism, is the way forward for the American nation, and must be represented in our economy."
 USA_promote_investment:0 "Promote Investment"
 USA_promote_investment_desc:0 "It is critical that our government promote investment both in the stock market and in economic sectors deserving of increased involvement from the federal government. Investing in failing industries will save jobs and keep unemployment low."
 USA_minimise_imports:0 "Minimise Imports"
 USA_minimise_imports_desc:0 "We should be working towards self-sufficiency in many economic sectors, both private and public. The United States of America once stood as one of the world's great global hegemons along with the Soviet Union, and as its natural successor, we should continue self-sufficiency, and build ourselves as a nation worthy of America's name."
 USA_adopt_centrist_economic_policy:0 "Adopt Centrist Economic Policy"
 USA_adopt_centrist_economic_policy_desc:0 "It seems the centrists have the right idea. Perhaps we could apply their economic theories to our next budget. A balance between leftism and rightism must be upheld, and populist economic systems only based on upholding a misguided loyalty to the people's belief are simply foolish. Only a centrist economic system can address the needs of the people."
 USA_high_company_tax:0 "High Company Tax"
 USA_high_company_tax_desc:0 "Raising taxes on corporations is the way forward. If corporations continue to dodge taxes utilizing havens and anti-worker attitudes and programs, our nation's unity and economy will suffer. What we must do is make sure taxes are properly applied to these corporate juggernauts, and raise the rates on the worst of the worst."
 USA_support_workers:0 "Support Workers"
 USA_support_workers_desc:0 "Previous governments have worked too closely with elites. We have to start from the ground up by supporting workers. It is important that the welfare of the general populace be safeguarded over the so-called necessities of rich elites."
 USA_federal_intervention:0 "Federal Intervention"
 USA_federal_intervention_desc:0 "The economy requires direct intervention from the federal government. With our executives leaving the country in droves for other free capitalist nations, it is clear we must supplement their loss with new programs designed to increase federal interference in the economy."
 USA_social_programs_for_laborers:0 "Social Programs for Laborers"
 USA_social_programs_for_laborers_desc:0 "The benefits of increased social programs and welfare simply outweigh the negatives. The American government must help its people so that they can help our government, and together create a relationship that unites both American politicians and the American populace."
 USA_industry_in_georgia:0 "Industry in Georgia"
 USA_industry_in_georgia_desc:0 "Georgia could do with more investment from the government. Agricultural farms, especially those specializing in peanuts, berries, and soybeans, can no longer suit the needs of a growing intelligent labor force in the state, which is why Georgia’s farming technologies must be improved upon."
 USA_industry_in_alabama:0 "Industry in Alabama"
 USA_industry_in_alabama_desc:0 "Alabama could do with more investment from the government. Much of Alabama’s industry has served to fuel large aerospace and military technology companies, but with our military already receiving large-scale government subsidies, the economy of Alabama must be significantly diversified."
 USA_industry_in_carolina:0 "Industry in Carolina"
 USA_industry_in_carolina_desc:0 "North and South Carolina could do with more investment from the government. Many of the manufacturing jobs that once were the lifeblood of Carolina’s industrial scene have now been lost to stable democratic nations across the world. With investment in the region, however, we can make sure we restore American jobs for American workers."
 USA_nationalist_policies:0 "Nationalist Policies"
 USA_nationalist_policies_desc:0 "The re-election of a Republican President has solidified our control over America's political system. We should capitalise on this advantage and push for new policies."
 USA_freedom_act:0 "Freedom Act"
 USA_freedom_act_desc:0 "Your freedom is protected by our surveillance. A new bill known as the "Freedom Act" by the American public shall ensure the personal rights of Americans by monitoring for pro-Soviet or pro-Commonwealth dissidents spouting their authoritarian rhetoric. In this time of national turmoil, America must be protected from traitors."
 USA_establish_new_nsa:0 "Establish New NSA"
 USA_establish_new_nsa_desc:0 "The National Security Agency was unfortunately abolished decades ago, but perhaps it could return with even more powers. With our nation beset by socialism and fascism, both collectivist evils that have attempted to subvert our great nation for decades, it is clear that our people must be monitored by the government so that these ideologies shall never hold relevance in Atlanta."
 USA_work_for_the_nation:0 "Work for the Nation"
 USA_work_for_the_nation_desc:0 "Greediness and welfare have done little to advance the economy into prosperity. Work for the nation, not the individual! New programs across America shall encourage full employment across our country, so that the unemployed do not have to rely on welfare and state expenditures. Americans must work harder instead of sapping the strength of the government!"
 USA_traditional_values:0 "Traditional Values"
 USA_traditional_values_desc:0 "Traditional Christian values should be protected by the federal government. With radical leftists across the world calling for the abolishment of the nuclear family and the destruction of traditional values, it is clear President [Root.GetLeader] must take a stand against modern progressivism and support the values that originally made America great."
 USA_rewrite_textbooks:0 "Rewrite Textbooks"
 USA_rewrite_textbooks_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that the curriculum has still failed to enforce traditional Republican values. Many of the leaders in this country fear that our people will embrace leftism and anti-Americanism due to the biased accounts of American history being taught in our schools. Instead, we must promote traditional American values and history, and remember our glorious past."
 USA_review_the_separation:0 "Review the Separation"
 USA_review_the_separation_desc:0 "Separation of church and state has been a failure. The two institutions should work together and in harmony. Our nation was built by and for Judeo-Christians so that their values of tradition, democracy, and freedom could be upheld. With atheism and alternative religions rising in popularity, our government must cement Christianity in the constitution of the American Republic itself."
 USA_liberty_is_paramount:0 "Liberty is Paramount"
 USA_liberty_is_paramount_desc:0 "The National Security Agency mustn't breach its guidelines regarding surveillance. Although rooting out communists and fascists is necessary for a stable America, the common people should have nothing to fear from their government. President [Root.GetLeader] has made it clear that such programs shall always safeguard the liberty of Americans before anything else."
 USA_secular_america:0 "Secular America"
 USA_secular_america_desc:0 "Some radicals have proposed abolishing the separation of church and state, but this would undermine the core secular values of America. America has never been a Christian nation, and the values of the 1st amendment have safeguarded freedom of worship in this great country for centuries. While we may not bear the name of the United States, we must continue their values."
 USA_one_nation_under_the_flag:0 "One Nation Under the Flag"
 USA_one_nation_under_the_flag_desc:0 "The President has too much control. The founders of the American Republic in 1776 designed our nation's constitution around the principles of checks and balances. A common belief in American nationalism, liberty, and justice should guide us, not a President with a cult of personality surrounding his every move."
 USA_conservative_policies:0 "Conservative Policies"
 USA_conservative_policies_desc:0 "The election of Bentley as President was a stunning upset and wakeup call for the Republicans. We should begin capitalising on this advantage immediately and push for new policies before our opposition can culminate behind a refined nationalist platform."
 USA_end_republican_dominance:0 "End Republican Dominance"
 USA_end_republican_dominance_desc:0 "Now that the people know a non-Republican candidate can seize the Presidency, special elections around the country will surely demolish the Republican Party. The Republican Party's control over the country in the past years has been nothing but authoritarian, and has crippled the democratic institutions that the Founding Fathers created for America."
 USA_end_of_the_personality_cult:0 "End of the Personality Cult"
 USA_end_of_the_personality_cult_desc:0 "A personality cult around George Bush Senior has existed since his arrival in Atlanta, ensuring that the Republicans would always have a firm grip over our country. With Jeb Bush's humiliating defeat in the 2010 elections, it is time to finally nip the cult in the bud, and show the people that Bush Sr. is anything but a humble populist."
 USA_life:0 "Life"
 USA_life_desc:0 "The first value that Thomas Jefferson enshrined in the Declaration of Independence was life. We must remember that no American should ever have their life threatened by the government or by malicious actors without just, legal repercussions for the act and that this right also extends to the unborn."
 USA_liberty:0 "Liberty"
 USA_liberty_desc:0 "The second value that Thomas Jefferson enshrined in the Declaration of Independence was liberty. Before and during Bentley's presidency, the Republicans have proposed sweeping surveillance legislation such as the Freedom Act and the restoration of the National Security Agency. Americans are entitled to liberty from search and seizure under their inalienable rights!"
 USA_pursuit_of_happiness:0 "Pursuit of Happiness"
 USA_pursuit_of_happiness_desc:0 "The third value that Thomas Jefferson enshrined in the Declaration of Independence was the pursuit of happiness. A value that has been forgotten by most socialists, each American should be entitled to economic opportunity through low taxes, low regulations, and low intervention. Property is just as much a right as any other."
 USA_a_proud_army:0 "A Proud Army"
 USA_a_proud_army_desc:0 "All soldiers should be proud to fight for President Bentley. America's military was once a source of pride and awe for the rest of the world, as they looked upon our sheer power as a force in the world. Although we should remain cautious about engaging in interventionism once more, our military must be strengthened and supported."
 USA_lower_taxes:0 "Lower Taxes"
 USA_lower_taxes_desc:0 "Low taxes are a core value of the conservative movement. While Rumsfeld was forced to hike taxes to pay for his costly interventions against communism, we are not in the same situation. The taxes imposed by the Republicans must be slashed so that the American people can continue to seek out opportunity!"
 USA_i_wish_i_was_in_dixie:0 "I Wish I Was In Dixie"
 USA_i_wish_i_was_in_dixie_desc:0 "The Republic's days are numbered. The South will rise again! Although many view the idea of the Confederacy as racist and vile, Davis' confederation of states was the only nation that truly embodied the values of the American south without succumbing to a Northern elite. Southern independence must be restored!"
 USA_begin_decentralisation:0 "Begin Decentralisation"
 USA_begin_decentralisation_desc:0 "Congress must pass amendments gradually decentralising the Republic. The old United States of America abandoned its principles of states' rights a long time ago in favor of centralizing power in the hands of Congress and the Presidency, a mistake that must be rectified."
 USA_weaken_the_president:0 "Weaken the President"
 USA_weaken_the_president_desc:0 "By weakening the President, we will ensure the states have ultimate power within the CSA. During times of national turmoil, the President was given the power to roll back habeas corpus and personal liberty without the approval of even Congress. This must change - the states, legislature, and by extension, the people, must have supreme power in our Republic."
 USA_draft_a_confederate_constitution:0 "Draft a Confederate Constitution"
 USA_draft_a_confederate_constitution_desc:0 "The old American constitution is outdated and irrelevant to the Confederate States. Instead, we should look to the shared heritage and values of the South, and draft a constitution truly befitting of the CSA."
 USA_proclaim_confederate_states:0 "Proclaim the Confederate States"
 USA_proclaim_confederate_states_desc:0 "The time has come! Once again the Confederate States of America will have their independence. With our unique culture, our traditions of liberty and democracy that have been forgotten by the Yankees, and our nationalism toward the Southern ideal, we must exist as an independent nation from the rest of America."
 USA_ensure_state_rights:0 "Ensure State Rights"
 USA_ensure_state_rights_desc:0 "For too long the states have been sidelined by a federal government. Now that we have curtailed the rights of the executive and the legislature, it is time to finally restore rights to the states and local authorities."
 USA_ensure_personal_rights:0 "Ensure Personal Rights"
 USA_ensure_personal_rights_desc:0 "President Bentley's reforms were still too moderate. We must ensure the rights of all Americans in this democracy. In a world where personal liberty has been trampled by authoritarian despots, even in our own continent, the CSA must stand as a beacon of constitutional principles."
 USA_ensure_security:0 "Ensure Security"
 USA_ensure_security_desc:0 "Some civil liberties can be done away with in the name of security and stability. Although we must ensure states' rights and constitutional textualism, our government must have the power to act against the threats that plague any democratic system."
 USA_cut_ties_to_the_usa:0 "Cut Ties to the USA"
 USA_cut_ties_to_the_usa_desc:0 "Our claims to the former United States are hindering efforts to improve relations both in the Americas and around the world. We are not the United States - we are the Confederate States of America, and heirs to the Old South, not some dead Yankee dream."
 USA_dc_for_virginia:0 "DC for Virginia"
 USA_dc_for_virginia_desc:0 "The Socialists want DC, we want Virginia. Perhaps a profitable agreement could be made between our two nations. After all, Virginia has no clear value to the Yankees, and DC would grant them significant legitimacy among the rest of America. The cradle of the South must return to the Confederacy!"
 USA_engage_with_south_america:0 "Engage With South America"
 USA_engage_with_south_america_desc:0 "Establishing stronger ties with South America is an inevitable way forward for the CSA. Although our new CSA has abandoned imperialism and interventionism, we must still stand strong on the world stage, and support Central and South American nations in their fight against Soviet incursion."
 USA_authority_and_strength:0 "Authority and Strength"
 USA_authority_and_strength_desc:0 "David Duke's election proved to the Republican elite that we want a strong leader with an iron fist. America must be strong if it is to survive the coming storm and oppose the communist menace that has taken control over half the nation."
 USA_restore_order:0 "Restore Order"
 USA_restore_order_desc:0 "In an unprecedented political situation, President Duke's party has faced a horrific result in the congressional elections. With chaos in the streets and a government without a mandate, order must be restored."
 USA_continue_military_leadership:0 "Continue Military Leadership"
 USA_continue_military_leadership_desc:0 "The junta will continue to maintain peace and order on our streets. With Congress in complete chaos following the failure of David Duke to establish a secure government and radical terrorist movements becoming more and more prominent, there is no choice but to temporarily suspend American democracy."
 USA_enforce_martial_law:0 "Enforce Martial Law"
 USA_enforce_martial_law_desc:0 "Martial law is necessary to keep the dissidents of our nation in check. Numerous revolutionary and activist organizations seeking only to destabilize the American Republic have come out of the woodwork, and must be taken off the streets if our constitutional principles are to endure."
 USA_secure_the_west:0 "Secure the West"
 USA_secure_the_west_desc:0 "The Western regions are unusually rebellious in this chaotic time. However, with the police and military, we can secure the West. With many pinning the attacks on Texan nationalists and democrats loyal to the Midwest Union and the APC, perhaps a direct military investigation would also suit the situation..."
 USA_establish_secret_police:0 "Establish Secret Police"
 USA_establish_secret_police_desc:0 "A secret police will remove dissidents once and for all. With opposition to the military government continuing to rise, it is necessary for our government to root out any traitors that are still lurking in the government of the American Republic, however high in the ranks they may be."
 USA_conservative_junta:0 "Conservative Junta"
 USA_conservative_junta_desc:0 "Some have suggested we follow in the ideals of democrats and certain leftists while still maintaining military leadership. However, such values will not help us rule with an iron fist. Instead, we must focus on ensuring that capitalism and traditional values are enshrined in our government, just as they were in our old administrations."
 USA_a_new_admiralty:0 "A New Admiralty"
 USA_a_new_admiralty_desc:0 "With the army under our control, the next step is creating a loyal American navy. Although the navy has been largely neglected on account of our government's recent focus on the army as opposed to other branches, it can still become just as strong as the other navies of America, if not stronger."
 USA_corporate_military_government:0 "Corporate Military Government"

 USA_a_legitimate_ruler:0 "A Legitimate Ruler"
 USA_a_legitimate_ruler_desc:0 "The last true President of the people was George Washington. His descendant today, Paul Emery Washington, shall be the first true people's King of America. Although many in our nation will take offence at the idea of an American monarchy, the rule of Paul I will provide stability and justice for all Americans."
 USA_consolidate_our_rule:0 "Consolidate Our Rule"
 USA_consolidate_our_rule_desc:0 "Monarchism is still an American ideology in its infancy. We should be working to consolidate the rule of Paul I. Inviting him to Atlanta to be fully coronated as King of America will allow the sceptical politicians of the South to understand that Paul I embodies the values and spirit of the American nation."
 USA_work_with_congress:0 "Work With Congress"
 USA_work_with_congress_desc:0 "True power in this country still lies with Congress, which is why the King should try to work with them. The great statesmen of George Washington's era understood the value of a legislature to check and challenge the rights of the executive, and we should not forget their teachings on civil government... even if they chose to embrace republicanism."
 USA_bypass_congress:0 "Bypass Congress"
 USA_bypass_congress_desc:0 "Congress is a useless government institution without any real power these days. The King doesn't need to worry about another few hundred people in his government. Paul I can speak for all Americans, unlike the executives and bureaucrats in Atlanta, and needs no guidance from pampered politicians."
 USA_establish_the_council_of_princes:0 "Establish the Council of Princes"
 USA_establish_the_council_of_princes_desc:0 "A pan-American Council of Princes will ensure Midwestern, Texan, Californian and any other Americans are represented in a future united kingdom. Furthermore, it shall allow us to grant the descendants of the founding fathers the positions and powers they are entitled to as descendants of the old American aristocracy."
 USA_fight_stigma:0 "Fight Stigma"
 USA_fight_stigma_desc:0 "In America there is still a lingering stigma concerning monarchism, as it was the ideology Washington himself fought against. However, they simply fail to see the glory it has brought and can bring us. Besides, Alexander Hamilton and his Federalists supported ideas which essentially advocate for an elective monarchy, all of which are embodied in our current government."
 USA_the_kings_army:0 "The King's Army"
 USA_the_kings_army_desc:0 "There shall be no army if it isn't in the King's name! A true Royal American Army will make the communists across the nation fear the might of the King of America, Paul Emery Washingon. By integrating many current military structures, we can even strengthen our old military in the process."
 USA_royal_investment:0 "Royal Investment"
 USA_royal_investment_desc:0 "Official investment from the royal family in both rural and urban industry will strengthen the economy and boost our popularity in certain regions. With so many Americans in poverty under the chaos of the Great Collapse and a lackluster Republican response, it is clear that the monarchy must take up the charge for economic justice."
 USA_end_this_turmoil:0 "End This Turmoil"
 USA_end_this_turmoil_desc:0 "The time has finally come to truly take hold of this country and end the turmoil. With the legacy of President David Duke's brief term and subsequent military takeover in the past, we can finally look to the future of a glorious American monarchy. For Paul I!"
 USA_crush_republicans:0 "Crush Republicans"
 USA_crush_republicans_desc:0 "Republican politicians currently have the most power in our Kingdom, but don't believe in the King's values or government. Although their predecessors once had faith in the American aristocracy, the current conservative movement is only interested in abandoning traditional values and enriching the power of corporations. They must go!"
 USA_befriend_kingdoms:0 "Befriend Kingdoms"
 USA_befriend_kingdoms_desc:0 "All monarchs around the world will soon know the name Paul the First. In time, perhaps we can restore America's position on the world stage, and challenge the supremacy of communists and republicans across the globe."
 USA_ensure_cia_loyalty:0 "Ensure CIA Loyalty"
 USA_ensure_cia_loyalty_desc:0 "The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency must swear absolute allegiance to the King, not his petty Presidents of days past. Although they would never be so silly as to coup their own people, their lack of loyalty and faith in the monarchy is altogether quite disturbing."
 USA_elect_a_pm:0 "Elect a Prime Minister"
 USA_elect_a_pm_desc:0 "Some elements of democracy are necessary, which is why we should hold an election for the first Prime Minister of America. A constitutional monarchy shall revitalize support for Paul I's regime and make it known to all Americans that a benevolent kingdom shall be the future of America for years to come."
 USA_showcase_stability:0 "Showcase Stability"
 USA_showcase_stability_desc:0 "We are finally stable, secure and open to all Americans. Although many originally saw our movement as a fringe, far-right movement that sought to betray the values that made America great, opinion on the monarchy has now changed. Now that democracy reigns once more in America, the world can understand that our regime is stable, and here to stay."
 USA_one_man_one_nation:0 "One Man, One Nation"
 USA_one_man_one_nation_desc:0 "Democracy no longer has any place in our society. There will be no Prime Minister. Democracy brought us the turmoil that destroyed America's superpower status, and democracy brought us the collapse of the United States as communists and liberals continued to erode tradition. Never again shall Americans be subject to the whims of corrupt politicians."
 USA_devotion_to_the_king:0 "Devotion to the King"
 USA_devotion_to_the_king_desc:0 "All citizens of this great nation will devote their working lives to the King. Paul I is the ideal monarch for America, and encapsulates the American Dream. Born from nothing, he was able to rise to the top of American politics, and now, he and his descendants will be honoured as the saviours of a nation many thought would never rise again."
 USA_corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
 USA_corporatism_desc:0 "Corporatism is the way forward. An American corporatocracy will restore control of our nation to those who can truly run it, not weak-willed politicians. Although many in the fascist movement will express anger at Duke from bending to corporate interests, it is clear that an America managed by corporations and businessmen will be more efficient than any democratic regime."
 USA_weaken_democratic_institutions:0 "Weaken Democratic Institutions"
 USA_weaken_democratic_institutions_desc:0 "Democratic institutions like Congress are destabilising this country and should have their powers limited. The politicians in Congress and the bureaucracy have no interest in repairing the economics of America, merely exploiting our nation's wealth for their own personal gain. If they all are corporate puppets anyway, as people say, then the puppeteers are already in power."
 USA_congress_of_businessmen:0 "Congress of Businessmen"
 USA_congress_of_businessmen_desc:0 "Gone is the Congress of ignorant politicians. A Congress of elite businessmen and intelligent executives will bring prosperity to America. No longer will the bloodhounds of American politics decide policy, but rather cool and collected entrepreneurs and corporate elites, who truly understand the spirit and state of America."
 USA_economic_revival_act:0 "Economic Revival Act"
 USA_economic_revival_act_desc:0 "The Economic Revival Act, proposed by several executives from Eastern Texas, will supposedly boost revenue significantly. In addition, perhaps the executives who fled during the Bush and Rumsfeld era will finally realize that America is back, and here to stay."
 USA_return_of_the_americans:0 "Return of the Americans"
 USA_return_of_the_americans_desc:0 "With news of a truly corporate America under the leadership of President David Duke reaching Canada and most of the international scene, it appears numerous executives are returning to America, so that they can finally return to their decaying businesses and heal our economy. We welcome their guidance!"
 USA_create_investment_advisory_council:0 "Create Investment Advisory Council"
 USA_create_investment_advisory_council_desc:0 "Businessmen must be advising our government's policy on industry and the economy at every turn. Skilled stock-brokers and leaders of powerful corporations will be the first members of a new IAC that will ensure our investments are sound, secure and above all, benefit American jobs."
 USA_promote_skilled_immigration:0 "Promote Skilled Immigration"
 USA_promote_skilled_immigration_desc:0 "National Renewal has traditionally attacked the idea of immigration, declaring that it would lead to large-scale demographic change and corrupt America's white majority population. Our businessmen disagree. A compromise will be reached, as corporate America seeks for skilled labour across the country, all the while maintaining many of Duke's personal prejudices on such issues."
 USA_remove_corporate_taxes:0 "Remove Corporate Taxes"
 USA_remove_corporate_taxes_desc:0 "Taxes on corporations destroy the ability for small businesses to spring up and challenge the mainstream, along with destroying even large corporations who require deregulation and opportunity to truly pursue innovation. Fortunately, these troublesome taxes will soon be abolished, so that corporate America can truly breathe."
 USA_target_the_independence_union:0 "Target the Independence Union"
 USA_target_the_independence_union_desc:0 "The Independence Union has aimed to limit the power of corporations in America ever since the Republican Party embraced hard right-wing economics, believing that low taxes and opportunity were core values of the conservative movement. They may be, but the Independence Union are also traitors who would despise any democracy of the businessmen, and therefore must be removed."
 USA_crush_personal_liberties:0 "Crush Personal Liberties"
 USA_crush_personal_liberties_desc:0 "Personal liberties have no place in a corporate society. One has no need to vote, to speak out against the regime, and engage in other acts that could jeopardize our control over American society when they can much more easily be dutiful and quiet cogs in a greater machine. We can not have the common people of America attacking our rule, or else our regime would be truly illegitimate."
 USA_power_to_the_corporations:0 "Power to the Corporations"
 USA_power_to_the_corporations_desc:0 "President Duke has been a willing puppet, but unfortunately, he has generated our regime too much controversy and comparisons to open fascism and xenophobia. For the sake of our reputation and the efficiency of our government, he shall be removed, and full powers will be given to the Congress of Corporations instead, which will now truly guide America."
 USA_power_to_the_president:0 "Power to the President"
 USA_power_to_the_president_desc:0 "President Duke must maintain his power so that he can protect against the abuses of the Congress of Corporations. Although many in his party have abandoned him due to his shift toward corporatocracy, the National Renewal Party and the presidency must remain the supreme bodies of American life, not any corrupt legislature."
 USA_ensure_protection:0 "Ensure Protection"
 USA_ensure_protection_desc:0 "Under the Free State of America, the common citizen is always protected from the interests of big government and socialism that now control the former United States of America. Our army shall crush any threats that would dare threaten the ability of every American to achieve a seat in the Congress of Corporations with opportunity and ingenuity!"
 USA_it_cant_happen_here:0 "It Can Happen Here"
 USA_it_cant_happen_here_desc:0 "A fascist government must come to America. With corporate control and interventionist politics corrupting the Republican Party from within, and the Independence Union and Democrats latching onto the weakness of liberal democracy, it is clear President Duke is the only man to restore authority and faith to the American Republic."
 USA_promote_traditional_american_values:0 "Promote Traditional American Values"
 USA_promote_traditional_american_values_desc:0 "No party in this nation truly has an interest in keeping traditional values intact. The Republicans are 10 years behind the Independence Union on social issues, who are 10 years behind the Democrats, but all in all, none are brave enough to truly oppose the relentless attacks on morality and tradition that have been pushed by corporate elites and liberal activists."
 USA_create_paramilitary:0 "Create Paramilitary"
 USA_create_paramilitary_desc:0 "A national army can protect our borders, but they cannot protect the lives of our citizens from internal threats. A paramilitary loyal to Duke and the National Renewal Party alone must be created, so that any who threaten the President and his policies can be dealt with accordingly."
 USA_strengthen_the_national_army:0 "Strengthen the National Army"
 USA_strengthen_the_national_army_desc:0 "The army of the American Republic must be strengthened and protected so that it can remain loyal to the American ideal and the President's vision. With anarchists and communists preparing for war on the border of Virginia, our army must be powerful enough to stop them in their tracks."
 USA_rigged_congressional_election:0 "Rigged Congressional Elections"
 USA_rigged_congressional_election_desc:0 "New, rigged congressional elections across the nation will show the people that the National Renewal Party is here to stay and that the presidency of David Duke was not mere chance. With significant opposition remaining in Congress and the courts, even with our election victory, such elections are crucial for our party to win."
 USA_promote_research:0 "Promote Research"
 USA_promote_research_desc:0 "America has been lagging behind the world in military and electronic research methods for years since the Great Collapse. This must be changed, even if we have to hire more and more scientists loyal to our government and its causes to handle such a monumental new research and development initiative."
 USA_outlaw_dissent:0 "Outlaw Dissent"
 USA_outlaw_dissent_desc:0 "Even with our secret police, dissent from the remaining traitors in Congress and corporate organizations has only increased.

 USA_megalomaniac_construction:0 "Megalomaniac Construction"
 USA_megalomaniac_construction_desc:0 "The people of America have forgotten the beauty of our great country, its leaders, and its history.

 USA_links_to_the_kkk:0 "Links to the KKK"
 USA_links_to_the_kkk_desc:0 "The Ku Klux Klan has risen to national prominence once more with a new surge in far-right nationalism, racial politics, and Christian identity.

 USA_enforce_segregation:0 "Enforce Segregation"
 USA_enforce_segregation_desc:0 "David Duke was too lenient on the issue of segregation, refusing to enforce it on a large-scale level.

 USA_abolish_the_federal_reserve_desc:0 "The Federal Reserve has no place in America any longer. A tool of Jewish and corporate interests, they have sabotaged our government ever since it came to power.

 USA_manipulate_the_media_desc:0 "The mainstream media has spread so many lies against David Duke and promoted so much slander that it is unbelievable the National Renewal Party even managed to win the presidency.

 ENG_privatise_the_nhs_desc:0 "Ridiculous leftists want to strengthen the National Health Service. But Mrs. Thatcher had the right idea: Privatisation is the proper British way. The free market is the best way to ensure quality service in all fields, including healthcare."

 ENG_royal_guidance:0 "Royal Guidance"
 ENG_royal_guidance_desc:0 "We need the royal family to be our allies. Having been the cornerstone of British society for centuries, their support is needed to legitimize our regime. After all, since old King Edward VIII was sympathetic to the cause, surely his niece must be as well."
 ENG_out_with_royalty:0 "Out With Royalty"
 ENG_out_with_royalty_desc:0 "Windsors will only get in our way. With the Queen's failed power grab in mind, and her son's rabid tree-hugging tendencies, we cannot trust them to be loyal to our regime. It's time for an end to the monarchy as we know it."

 ENG_new_training_exercises:0 "New Training Exercises"
 ENG_new_training_exercises_desc:0 "From the UK to Ireland and Ireland to Ulster, all soldiers will be trained by those with the highest qualifications. This will also help tying the Protection Union much closer together and bridge the gaps between Briton and Irishman!"

 ENG_invite_iran_desc:0 "While Iran and Britain have had a sordid history, fifty years have passed since the last bump on the road. Hopefully, the time passed has made the Iranians forgive us, so that they would be willing to join in our alliance and be a strong bastion in the Middle East."
 ENG_irish_trade:0 "Irish Trade"

 ENG_trade_with_west_africa_desc:0 "West Africa is a developing country, and thus yearning for capital with which to modernize and develop.

 ENG_defend_the_skies:0 "Defend the Skies"
 ENG_defend_the_skies_desc:0 "The 20th century proved that there's a third dimension to warfare: The airspace. Today, even the mightiest armies and navies can be destroyed by air power. If we are to protect Britain from foreign threats, we must remember that we shall rule the third dimension too."

For Socialism to blossom in both Wales and Scotland, they need a chance to chart their own path, naturally hand in hand with us. We must begin working towards a Confederal Britain."
 ENG_federation:0 "Federation"
 ENG_federation_desc:0 "While the Scottish and Welsh hold legitimate grievances towards the British state, to merely cut them loose and tell them to go their own way would be an uncomradely decision. Instead, we must make our Republic work for them too, by embracing the idea of a federal system, so we can all build Socialism in Great Britain together!"
 ENG_union_state:0 "Union State"
 ENG_union_state_desc:0 "Britain is a sole beacon of true Socialism, surrounded by enemies on all sides. If we are to persevere through such hostile waters, we must stand together, no matter how much the Scottish and Welsh will niggle about it. Control from London must be strengthened if we are to survive."
 ENG_workers_of_england:0 "Workers of England"

 ENG_workers_of_wales:0 "Workers of Wales"
 ENG_workers_of_wales_desc:0 "Ever since being conquered in 1283, Wales has merely been regarded as an extension of England. The workers of Wales deserve better than this! The Welsh transition to independence must be aided, so that Wales is capable of standing on her own feet once more."

 ENG_further_centralisation_desc:0 "London is the beating heart of the Republic, the centre from which the revolution emanates! And yet too large parts of the economy are left to languish in the inefficiency of devolution.

 ENG_trotskys_way:0 "Trotsky's Way"
 ENG_trotskys_way_desc:0 "Socialism will never prevail without war declared upon imperialists.

Trotsky knew the way, only through perpetual revolutionary warfare can we secure a future for the working class."
 ENG_socialism_through_peace:0 "Socialism Through Peace"
 ENG_socialism_through_peace_desc:0 "Socialism is not about war or violence. It is about uniting all humans under one banner of equality.

 ENG_cooperate_with_americans:0 "Cooperate With Americans"
 ENG_cooperate_with_americans_desc:0 "Now is the time to unite the strongest revolutionary nations. In the pre-Revolutionary era, the former United States and Britain had a special relationship.

 ENG_renewed_patriotism_desc:0 "All British workers will be proud to wave the flag. Not the flag of the aristocrats, who lorded over them, nor the flag of the capitalists who sent them off to die in distant wars.

 ENG_pro_soviet_propaganda:0 "Pro-Soviet Propaganda"
 ENG_pro_soviet_propaganda_desc:0 "The Soviet Union is a force for good in this world of imperialist villains, and our state media should showcase that.

 ENG_communist_ministries:0 "Communist Ministries"
 ENG_communist_ministries_desc:0 "The many ministries of Britain are powerless institutions, only given the bare minimum of power needed to ensure that the pockets of the bourgeoisie are always lined, with few regulatory powers, if any.

 ENG_overthrow_the_academic_elite_desc:0 "With their unbreakable connections to innately reactionary institutions like Eton, the pretentious academic elite of Britain are holding back a full revolution for the British people. Even if it might hurt our scientific efforts in the short run, we must rid ourselves of their influence."
 ENG_peasants_revolution:0 "Peasants' Revolution"
 ENG_peasants_revolution_desc:0 "A British revolution is a peasant's revolution. After all, some of the first Communists in Britain were the Diggers, who fought to maintain the Common lands from the greed of the aristocracy, and so the primacy of the farmers must be upheld."
 ENG_workers_revolution:0 "Workers' Revolution"

 ENG_join_china:0 "Join China"

 ENG_red_navy_desc:0 "Britain is becoming a true island fortress, one that even the most well-armed of reactionaries would fear attack. We're just missing one piece of the puzzle: A strong navy, an impenetrable steel wall guarding the British Isles. The British Red Navy will be reorganized, so it may soon make the seas run red. Britannia rules the waves!"
 ENG_war_with_spain:0 "War With Spain"

 ENG_new_house_of_lords_desc:0 "A House of Lords loyal to our administration will do wonders for total consolidation of power.

 ITA_general_election_desc:0 "It's finally time to hold the general election that many have been eagerly anticipating. Although many Italians are reluctant about voting after decades of Communist faux-elections, optimism fills the air as voters all over the country go to the polls."
 ITA_democratic_constitution:0 "Democratic Constitution"
 ITA_democratic_constitution_desc:0 "The Communist Constitution may have contained all of the basic civil rights that a civilised society contains, but they rang as hollow as pasta penne. This new constitution shall enshrine the rights of all Italians and leave us with a more stable democratic society in the future."
 ITA_italeave:0 "Italeave"
 ITA_italeave_desc:0 "The European Union is a socialist monstrosity, feeding off of all of its members to enrich the Eurocrats in Brussels and Berlin, one that must be destroyed as soon as possible. However, at the moment Italy should simply leave the organisation. They’re getting nothing from us. None of them! Italeave means Italeave!"
 ITA_italian_republic:0 "Italian Republic"
 ITA_italian_republic_desc:0 "Italy's last democratic system was a republic, so that is what we shall have in the 21st century. A unitary republic is the way to ensuring that our democratic spring can be maintained against the many forces that assail it."
 ITA_italian_confederation:0 "Italian Confederation"
 ITA_italian_confederation_desc:0 "Despite the efforts of successive governments, Italy remains a diverse nation. The Republic failed to appease various regions and represent every Italian. A confederation of nations should be established instead." 
 ITA_united_nation:0 "United Nation"
 ITA_united_nation_desc:0 "Every regional difference is a potential fissure that can be levied against our fledgling democracy. Separatism will only cause harm to this new Italian Republic. We must remind everyone from Veneto to Aosta, from Lombardy to Sicily, that they are all Italians."
 ITA_executive_presidency:0 "Executive Presidency"
 ITA_executive_presidency_desc:0 "Italian democracy was only restored thanks to a powerful, benevolent president. There is no longer a need for a Prime Minister; such a figure would only muddle the decision-making powers of our government."
 ITA_oligarchic_republic:0 "Oligarchic Republic"
 ITA_oligarchic_republic_desc:0 "Oligarchs shall hold the keys to our economy, and it will certainly flourish from this point onwards. While it may be a bitter pill to swallow, empowering these oligarchs with the control of our economy will protect it against communist subterfuge."
 ITA_spread_democracy:0 "Spread Democracy"
 ITA_spread_democracy_desc:0 "We have been on the defensive long enough. Italy now has the divine right to spread democracy in a terrified Europe. With democracy restored at home and the economy fortified, we stand ready to cross the Rubicon and go on the offensive."
 ITA_high_morale:0 "High Morale"
 ITA_high_morale_desc:0 "We are not just fighting for any cause, we are fighting to spread the light of the torch of liberty across all of Europe. If the people believe in our cause, then we will be stronger than ever. We must remind the people of what communism took from them, of what it’s taking from all the peoples of Europe!"
 ITA_reaffirm_party_rule:0 "Reaffirm Party Rule"
 ITA_reaffirm_party_rule_desc:0 "Though this may be a trying time for all of us, we must remember that we’ve made it through worse. With the illustrious guidance of the Partito Comunista Italiano leading us on, we can rest assured that we shall weather this crisis, as we’ve weathered all those prior!"
 ITA_ban_refugees:0 "Ban Refugees"
 ITA_ban_refugees_desc:0 "Refugees have no right to come into Italy and bring their savagery along as well. What notions of class consciousness they possess have been warped by the thug Gaddafi, and their faith is anathema to our socialist society. These ‘refugees’ can find another place to live."
 ITA_open_seas_campaign:0 "Open Seas Campaign"
 ITA_open_seas_campaign_desc:0 "Despite our ban on refugees, they keep coming over in their little rafts and boats. We should send a stronger signal: send in the navy to patrol the Mediterranean waters and turn back any and all riff raff trying to enter our socialist state illegally."
 ITA_party_unity:0 "Party Unity"
 ITA_party_unity_desc:0 "Our methods of dealing with the refugee crisis have been effective. Maybe a bit too effective. Some members of the Communist Party have complained that our hardline stance was antithesis to the communist ideal. We will brush aside their criticisms, for we must once again learn to work together and strengthen the party as a whole."
 ITA_assimilation:0 "Assimilation"
 ITA_assimilation_desc:0 "Refugees from Libya and Tunisia must be given the ability to assimilate into our way of life. By offering them language and ideological education, we can ensure that these huddling masses coming to our shores have the opportunity of a future in Italy."
 ITA_humanity_for_all:0 "Humanity for All"
 ITA_humanity_for_all_desc:0 "Refugees are human, and the socialist cause is one of common humanity. To leave them adrift in the Mediterranean would be a dereliction of our most fundamental duties. Let them all in."
 ITA_put_them_to_work:0 "Put Them to Work"
 ITA_put_them_to_work_desc:0 "If we are to give our refugees a dignified future, then we must also offer them the dignity of work, of honest employment for the socialist future. We can put them to work in our industries and bring them not just into the jobs, but into our Italian homes and hearts."
 ITA_foreign_policy:0 "Foreign Policy"
 ITA_foreign_policy_desc:0 "With the refugee crisis resolved, [Root.GetLeader] should be focusing on foreign policy at the moment. With the fall of the Pax Sovietica, we must take a stand in an ever more uncertain world."
 ITA_european_communism:0 "European Communism"
 ITA_european_communism_desc:0 "The Soviet order and Warsaw Pact are both dying. Communism must be readjusted to be based in the heart of Europe. The European Union holds the seeds to the socialist future, we must nurture these, so that they one day will blossom into a beautiful, red rose."
 ITA_negotiate_with_the_balkans:0 "Negotiate With the Balkans"
 ITA_negotiate_with_the_balkans_desc:0 "The Balkan region is in dire need of help from another wealthier government. Negotiations could secure their loyalty to Italy and its cause in Europe."
 ITA_negotiate_with_western_europe:0 "Negotiate With Western Europe"
 ITA_negotiate_with_western_europe_desc:0 "A political alliance between the Western European communist parties and Italy's in particular will be greatly beneficial to the cause. We will need their support if we are to unify the European Union."
 ITA_the_soviet_order:0 "The Soviet Order"
 ITA_the_soviet_order_desc:0 "Eurocommunism is ridiculous. Europe is made up of too many disparate peoples who only recently were able to come together. Any notion that thousands of years of history can be put aside would only serve to undo the good we have been able to do already with the European Union."
 ITA_invest_in_germany:0 "Invest in Germany"
 ITA_invest_in_germany_desc:0 "Germany, despite being the most prosperous state in the European Union, could always use a helping hand. Let us invest in their economy, to remind them of who their friends really are."
 ITA_domestic_policy:0 "Domestic Policy"
 ITA_domestic_policy_desc:0 "The refugee crisis has revealed a surprising amount of cracks in our previously seamless society. [Root.GetLeader] should be focusing on domestic policy at the moment, as we need to untangle those knots if Socialism is to be preserved."
 ITA_support_workers:0 "Support Workers"
 ITA_support_workers_desc:0 "The workers of Italy are the true torchbearers of our revolution. With a blanket increase of all benefits and pensions, we can show them our gratitude for their hard work for the socialist state."
 ITA_promote_gender_equality:0 "Promote Gender Equality"
 ITA_promote_gender_equality_desc:0 "How can society be equal if the two genders aren't represented and treated equally? A socialism only for men is no socialism at all, for our female comrades have done just as much for the revolution as the male ones."
 ITA_crackdown_on_nationalist_dissent:0 "Crackdown on Nationalist Dissent"
 ITA_crackdown_on_nationalist_dissent_desc:0 "All over Italy, our socialist state is under assault from a resurgent right. Claiming that our works are but mere sell-outery to the bolshevik menace, they are attracting more attention than what their slanderous words are warranted. No need to worry however, Mr. President, these fascists will quickly be crushed."
 ITA_southern_nationalisation:0 "Southern Nationalisation"
 ITA_southern_nationalisation_desc:0 "Unlike most other EU members, Italy has maintained some extremely limited privatisation in the South. That ends now. The remaining capitalist enterprises of the South must be brought underfoot, and their means of production will be put to the use for the common wealth."
 ITA_showcase_economic_superiority:0 "Showcase Economic Superiority"
 ITA_showcase_economic_superiority_desc:0 "Italy has been the second most politically and economically powerful nation within the European Union. It's time we showcased that superiority."
 ITA_mafia_alliance:0 "Mafia Alliance"
 ITA_mafia_alliance_desc:0 "The Mafia can help keep us in power and in control of the country. While organized crime is illegal, and the root of so much of the corruption that plagues our land, the Mafia also has access to certain groups that would normally be beyond the reach of the Party. An alliance would be the best way of ensuring continued Communist governance."
 ITA_crush_the_northern_movements:0 "Crush the Northern Movements"
 ITA_crush_the_northern_movements_desc:0 "The Northern independence movements are living perpetually blind-folded, believing they’re better off without their comrades in the South. That insolent separatism is a threat to the social fabric of our state, and to our promise of equality for all Italians. They must be silenced, before their poisonous words fall on any more ears."
 ITA_destroy_the_mafia:0 "Destroy the Mafia"

 ITA_end_corruption_culture:0 "End Corruption Culture"
 ITA_end_corruption_culture_desc:0 "Despite mass-propaganda, corruption has survived in Italy for many decades. Clearly a different approach is needed. The SISS will be put to the task of cleaning up our governmental apparatus, from top to bottom, with harsh punishments for corruption to be issued to any and all corrupt officials. A few public examples should be enough to scare the rest."
 ITA_research_teams:0 "Research Teams"
 ITA_research_teams_desc:0 "With our universities no longer clogged by corruption, we can make sure that our plentiful research grants actually reach our research teams, and with that, Italy can lead Europe in scientific development!"
 ITA_a_strong_party:0 "A Strong Party"
 ITA_a_strong_party_desc:0 "Communists are unstoppable in this country. No one can match our strength anymore. The wish of the partisan in the struggle against Nazifascism has at long last come true. As we parade victoriously past the flower by the mountain side, let us cherish their sacrifice that paved the way for the PCI to cement its place as the liberator of the people."
 ITA_get_southerners_working_again:0 "Get Southerners Working Again"
 ITA_get_southerners_working_again_desc:0 "Even if our capitalist past is to blame for the inequalities between North and South, there are also noted differences in work ethic. Those lazy Southerners need more incentives to work. Or perhaps we could be a bit firmer in our words. Equalizing our country requires the effort of everyone, from the Alps to the Serre Calabresi."
 ITA_military_advancement:0 "Military Advancement"
 ITA_military_advancement_desc:0 "Advancing the military should be a top priority for this administration. Our soldiers will need the best training and equipment for the times ahead, nothing less will make do."
 ITA_proud_italian_army:0 "Proud Italian Army"
 ITA_proud_italian_army_desc:0 "Our soldiers can finally be proud of the forces they serve in. With the Bandiera Rossa waving proudly above as our armed forces march to victory, we can be certain that they stand firmly behind the party, proud of their service to the cause of Communism."
 ITA_appease_catholics:0 "Appease Catholics"
 ITA_appease_catholics_desc:0 "Despite the long period of state atheism that has ruled in our country, we have not forgotten our roots. Catholicism has been and shall remain a driving force in our political system. Removing the oppressive laws against the true faith are as such a mere formality."
 ITA_condemn_human_rights_violations:0 "Condemn Human Rights Violations"
 ITA_condemn_human_rights_violations_desc:0 "The Italian Communist Party has violated various treaties regarding human rights in the past. That comes to an end now. No longer may this so-called people’s state infringe on the people’s rights to freely speak and congregate."
 ITA_the_presidents_speech:0 "The President's Speech"
 ITA_the_presidents_speech_desc:0 "President Napolitano now has the opportunity to address the country again. This time however, he shall be talking about an entirely different path for Italy, rather than the refugee crisis."
 ITA_silence_hardline_factions:0 "Silence Hardline Factions"
 ITA_silence_hardline_factions_desc:0 "Hardline communists no longer have any place within this administration. Their wanton resistance to Napolitano’s highly necessary reform programme is not welcome, so neither will they be."
 ITA_meet_the_pope:0 "Meet the Pope"
 ITA_meet_the_pope_desc:0 "The exiled Pope has requested a meeting with President Napolitano. As we are turning over a new leaf and mending the relations with the Church, we are only obliged to accept."
 ITA_host_the_papal_conclave:0 "Host the Papal Conclave"
 ITA_host_the_papal_conclave_desc:0 "Pope Paul VII's shocking abdication has paved the way for a Papal Conclave. As a gesture of good will, we should offer to host it in Rome... for the first time in many decades."
 ITA_overthrow_congress:0 "Overthrow Congress"
 ITA_overthrow_congress_desc:0 "The National Congress is an institution purely aimed at crushing opposition to itself. As they are no doubt readying to remove Napolitano, let us see how effectively those pencil pushers can crush opposition in the form of tanks driving down the Via del Corso."
 ITA_dissolve_the_high_council:0 "Dissolve the High Council"
 ITA_dissolve_the_high_council_desc:0 "The High Council of Defence has served us well, but perhaps we need to rethink our military organisation once again. For the Italian army to be a modern army, we must likewise have a modern high command."
 ITA_new_strategies:0 "New Strategies"
 ITA_new_strategies_desc:0 "Our current doctrines are a Cold War vestige from a time when American generals feared that Soviet tanks would come rampaging through the Fulda Gap. With a new century comes new rules of warfare, new rules that we must adapt to if we are to persevere on the battlefield."
 ITA_italian_air_supremacy:0 "Italian Air Supremacy"
 ITA_italian_air_supremacy_desc:0 "There are no planes in Europe like ours, but behind every good plane there ought to be a good pilot, well-rehearsed in the tactics and strategies of air combat. We must reemphasise training for both our brave comrades in the air as well as their commanders on the ground and in the control towers."
 ITA_new_naval_command:0 "New Naval Command"
 ITA_new_naval_command_desc:0 "Two thousand years ago, we called the Mediterrannean ‘Mare Nostrum’, our sea. While two thousand years have gone, and new powers have come and went, we must not forget the past. With a shake-up of the Italian naval command, we can easily set sail and make it Mare Nostrum once again."
 ITA_new_weaponry:0 "New Weaponry"
 ITA_new_weaponry_desc:0 "Italy has a strong armaments industry, with some of our factories and companies going back to the Renaissance. While the Pax Sovietica has meant that we haven’t exactly focused on building the newest firearms, we have not let this armaments industry deteriorate. With the winds of change blowing, it might be time to once more put them to work."
 ITA_italian_air_technologies:0 "Italian Air Technologies"
 ITA_italian_air_technologies_desc:0 "War is not a question of the flashiest weapons or smartest generals, but of industrial logistics. But with the flashiest weapons in the air, we can reduce enemy industry to cinders and thus deprive them of this key warfaring asset. New strategic bombers are a must, as we build the Armed Forces of the future."
 ITA_tanks_of_europe:0 "Tanks of Europe"
 ITA_tanks_of_europe_desc:0 "The venerable tank has been a mainstay of the army ever since the First World War, and even as armies gear up for warfare in the age of electronics, it would be unwise to disregard the potential of an armoured, tracked cannon."
 ITA_technological_revolution:0 "Technological Revolution"
 ITA_technological_revolution_desc:0 "Warfare has a tendency of making the most of whatever technology that exists, and who knows what potential our current basis of technology holds. Our military engineers are definitely eager to find out, they just need the go-ahead."
 ITA_ships_of_the_mediterranean:0 "Ships of the Mediterranean"
 ITA_ships_of_the_mediterranean_desc:0 "The Italian navy has long had a history of competence, and even today our admirals are carrying that legacy onwards. For this new age, however, they will need newer ships. Let’s give them some, and have our ingenious ship designers draw up some new designs to rule the Mediterranean with!"
 ITA_new_soldiers:0 "New Soldiers"
 ITA_new_soldiers_desc:0 "The advent of miniaturized electronics has not just been a boon to the citizenry, but also to the armed forces. Even then, so much potential is yet unrealized. With electronic equipment, hitherto unimaginable avenues for aiding the common footsoldier have been opened. We should develop a fully electronic combat suite for our brave men on the frontlines."
 ITA_national_recruitment_campaign:0 "National Recruitment Campaign"
 ITA_national_recruitment_campaign_desc:0 "Even with all the best equipment and the wisest generals, nothing would be accomplished without men to carry that equipment and fulfill the orders of the command staff. We should encourage all young Italians to join our armed forces, to bolster our ranks and protect our fraternal homeland."
 ITA_speech_to_the_masses:0 "Speech to the Masses"
 ITA_speech_to_the_masses_desc:0 "As our armed forces are reforged, we should remember to celebrate them. [Root.GetLeader] will hold a national televised speech, thanking all of those who make the sacrifices necessary to keep Italy safe and sound."
 ITA_enforce_an_old_guard:0 "Enforce an Old Guard"
 ITA_enforce_an_old_guard_desc:0 "The loudest voices aren’t always the wisest. Despite the many calls to dismiss the old High Council of Defense from the government, we should keep in mind that this is the exact same High Council of Defense that has kept Italy safe for decades, even in the midst of a refugee crisis. Talent should be rewarded, not punished."
 ITA_status_quo_doctrine:0 "Status Quo Doctrine"
 ITA_status_quo_doctrine_desc:0 "The more things change, the more they stay the same. This goes just as much for the armed forces as anything else. What our courageous soldiers need isn’t new generals, just better intelligence to more effectively carry out their orders. We should investigate the possibilities for connecting our armies with the newest spy satellites, to ensure that our armies have real-time intel on any and all enemies."
 ITA_carabinieri:0 "Carabinieri"
 ITA_carabinieri_desc:0 "While Italy has long seen peace abroad, the Carabinieri have since 1814 fought to keep peace at home. With such service also follows experience in many matters, from handling terrorists to simple lessons of organization. These lessons should not go to waste, it should be shared to all departments of our armed forces, to ensure that our brave soldiers have all the support they need."
 ITA_support_research:0 "Support Research"
 ITA_support_research_desc:0 "Even if we are sticking to what works, it does not hurt to improve what we have. With newer equipment, our soldiers are always capable of doing better, and so it is only natural that they have it."

 ITA_arrest_the_communist_party_desc:0 "Once more, the Right will rule Italy! And... we shall have peace."
 ITA_enforce_military_rule:0 "Enforce Military Rule"
 ITA_enforce_military_rule_desc:0 "We cannot entrust the future of our country to the Church. When our country was united, Italy firmly rejected Papal rule, and such a decision must be respected. Instead, as the only proper vanguard of our country, the military has a right to rule Italy. Only Camporini knows what steps must be taken in the time ahead."
 ITA_continue_production:0 "Continue Production"
 ITA_continue_production_desc:0 "War is like a ferocious beast, hungry and ever yearning for more; more tanks, more guns, and more planes. If we are to successfully tame that beast, we must have the equipment to do so. With some key expansions of the military-industrial complex, we can produce more tanks, more guns and more planes to sate the appetite of the second horseman."
 ITA_standard_aircraft:0 "Standard Aircraft"
 ITA_standard_aircraft_desc:0 "A hodgepodge of aircraft is good for nothing. Experience gained in the cockpit of one plane may hardly be relevant for piloting another. To ensure that our brave airmen have the most skills and experience, we should streamline our airborne equipment, so the pipeline from training to combat pilot is as smoothly travelled as possible."
 ITA_temporary_democracy:0 "Temporary Democracy"
 ITA_temporary_democracy_desc:0 "The democratic institutions of our country have proven incapable of protecting it against subversive leftist influences, but yet they provide some measure of legitimacy. Temporary democracy is required to restore the King to his rightful throne, only then will the people believe in the righteousness of His Majesty."
 ITA_constitutional_referendum:0 "Constitutional Referendum"
 ITA_constitutional_referendum_desc:0 "With the Communist Party shown to be the monster it truly is, the people of Italy will certainly vote for monarchy over another Republic. While fraud was necessary to abolish this cherished institution in 1946, we shall prove ourselves magnanimous and allow a truly free vote. We don’t need to cheat anyways."
 ITA_crown_the_new_king:0 "Crown the New King"
 ITA_crown_the_new_king_desc:0 "The worst injustice done to our country since its foundation has at long last been undone. The Monarchy is returning to Italy, with the crown soon to be placed upon the head of His Majesty Victor Emmanuel IV. God save the King!"
 ITA_destroy_republican_parties:0 "Destroy Republican Parties"
 ITA_destroy_republican_parties_desc:0 "With their ceaseless, inane cries about an allegedly fraudulent restoration, Republicans have no place in this country. Their blatant disrespect for the wishes of the Italian people has gone on long enough. Remove them, as soon as possible."
 ITA_coalition_with_populists:0 "Coalition With Populists"
 ITA_coalition_with_populists_desc:0 "These right wing populists will spread our monarchist message throughout the nation. Soon the King will have total control over all political institutions, and Italian society as a whole."
 ITA_patriarchal_values:0 "Patriarchal Values"
 ITA_patriarchal_values_desc:0 "Just as the King is the father of Italy and head of our national household, so must fathers all over Italy likewise head theirs. God created the man to labour and to lead and the woman to care for him as he did so. The shrill man-haters will be shut up as we restore the natural order of things."
 ITA_decadent_society:0 "Decadent Society"
 ITA_decadent_society_desc:0 "We aren't royals for nothing. What good is being royalty if you cannot celebrate it? As thanks for their ceaseless, restless work for our country, the royal family obviously deserves to be rewarded with all we can offer them: The newest lamborghinis, the finest wines, and expensive trips to the vacation paradises of the world."
 ITA_power_to_the_military:0 "Power to the Military"
 ITA_power_to_the_military_desc:0 "Now is not the time for useless bickering between the government and military. As thanks for their role in the abolition of the Communist regime and the return of the Monarchy, His Majesty has seen it fit to handsomely reward General Camporini and the armed forces with more funds and influence within the Italian government."
 ITA_appoint_a_prime_minister:0 "Appoint a Prime Minister"
 ITA_appoint_a_prime_minister_desc:0 "Even though His Majesty enjoys a paramount position within Italy, he needn’t do everything alone. A strong prime minister by His side would showcase to the Italians that he still values their democratic rights. Constitutional monarchy is the way forward."
 ITA_betray_the_savoys:0 "Betray the Savoys"
 ITA_betray_the_savoys_desc:0 "Prime Minister Berlusconi understands the downsides to the Savoy monarchy, and the bad message it sends to our people. A dynasty ruling the Kingdom of Italy long before Savoys could even dream of it should be given control instead; the dynasty of Napoleon, the Bonapartes."
 ITA_crush_the_piedmont_rebellion:0 "Crush the Piedmont Rebellion"
 ITA_crush_the_piedmont_rebellion_desc:0 "Hell hath no fury like a Savoy scorned. Those silly little usurpers seem to have risen up in the Northwest, in their ancestral homelands. With this military operation, the repulsive Savoys will soon cease to exist, leaving only the true kings of Italy to rule our lands."
 ITA_celebrate_our_history:0 "Celebrate Our History"
 ITA_celebrate_our_history_desc:0 "No longer shall this family be but a footnote in the pages of history! The Italian Bonapartes are just as important for Italian history as any other leaders, be it Caesar or Mussolini. Let them feature boldly in our history books!"
 ITA_dynastic_connections:0 "Dynastic Connections"
 ITA_dynastic_connections_desc:0 "The Bernadotte Family who reign over Sweden actually have ties to our noble dynasty. As we are beginning to restore the old Continental system, perhaps Sweden could be the first member. The Bernadottes and the Bonapartes share a long and cherished history, hopefully those ties can once again be rekindled."
 ITA_a_strong_leader:0 "A Strong Leader"
 ITA_a_strong_leader_desc:0 "The King will not bow to pressure. With Berlusconi as his right-hand man, these two brave leaders shall be the end-all of decision making in Italy. Nobody else may enter our vaunted halls of power, for only with an iron grip can the future of Italy be built."
 ITA_build_a_bulwark:0 "Build a Bulwark"
 ITA_build_a_bulwark_desc:0 "Italy will be unstoppable in its defence of tradition against the red menace. The Alps, once an impenetrable fortress protecting our homeland from the barbarians seeking to undo all we have wrought, will be made into a veritable bastion of Italy, as fortifications will line every inch of territory the Reds would try attacking..."

 ITA_rule_the_old_seas:0 "Rule the Old Seas"
 ITA_rule_the_old_seas_desc:0 "A navy doesn’t need to sail all seven seas to be effective, it just needs to be able to guarantee coastal security. With our country surrounded by the Mediterranean, we would do well to secure our coasts and islands from anyone who’d want to attack us."
 ITA_commission_current_designs:0 "Commission Current Designs"
 ITA_commission_current_designs_desc:0 "The Italian Navy has seen better days. Many of its ships are aging, and in dire needs of upgrades or replacements within the coming years. Particularly the submarine fleet is out of date, for which we should commission a series of new designs, so that Italy may not just rule the seas, but the depths as well."
 ITA_mass_privatisation:0 "Mass Privatisation"
 ITA_mass_privatisation_desc:0 "This socialist era is at an end. Nationalisation must follow as well. We must return the entire economic apparatus to its rightful owners or their heirs. We have a communistic mess to untangle, but for the sake of justice, we have to do it."
 ITA_legacy_of_corporate_monarchism:0 "Legacy of Corporate Monarchism"
 ITA_legacy_of_corporate_monarchism_desc:0 "While the planned economy of the Italian Union must be put behind us, we cannot deny that state intervention had benefits. Another solution must be found, and can be found in Italian history. Looking back at Mussolini’s Italy, it is clear that corporatism is the right direction for our economy."
 ITA_protect_the_heartland:0 "Protect the Heartland"
 ITA_protect_the_heartland_desc:0 "The heart of the old Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in the North should be protected no matter the costs. Allowing that to fall would not only remove our base of support, but would also be an insult against His Majesty the King Bonaparte of historic proportions."
 ITA_ensure_savoy_dominance:0 "Ensure Savoy Dominance"
 ITA_ensure_savoy_dominance_desc:0 "The Savoys cannot be touched. With the loyalty of the Prime Minister assured, we can be certain that Italy can look forward to not just a long reign of prosperity, but also of the freedom and civil liberties previously stolen by the Communists."
 ITA_compromise_with_centrists:0 "Compromise With Centrists"
 ITA_compromise_with_centrists_desc:0 "Centrists have some excellent plans for Italy, in both a political and economic sense. If we are to truly recover from Communist rule, we must implement these posthaste."

 ITA_risorgimento_through_peace:0 "Risorgimento Through Peace"
 ITA_risorgimento_through_peace_desc:0 "Italy hasn't truly been unified since the collapse of democracy in 1984. A new internal Risorgimento is needed to bring this country together again. The Prime Minister is certain this can be achieved."
 ITA_incentives_for_south_tyrol:0 "Incentives for South Tyrol"
 ITA_incentives_for_south_tyrol_desc:0 "One symbol among many of how the European Union has utterly circumvented public opinion, Alto Adige was unfairly ripped from us and granted to the Germans. Violence doesn’t necessarily have to be the fix for this, however. In exchange for certain incentives, surely the Germans will give up South Tyrol to our administration."
 ITA_defend_italys_borders:0 "Defend Italy's Borders"
 ITA_defend_italys_borders_desc:0 "Italy must be defended on every border. With the Reds still being out there and no doubt angry that justice has been restored to Italy, it is imperative that we must not cede a single centimeter of land to them whenever they try to assail our homeland."
 ITA_loyal_senate:0 "Loyal Senate"
 ITA_loyal_senate_desc:0 "While most institutions of government have acknowledged that the Monarchy has come to stay, the newly reinstated Senate remains the last bastion of Republicanism in government. If it wants to remain an entity, it must pledge allegiance to the monarch, or it will go the same way as the National Congress of the old Communist Party."
 ITA_march_on_rome:0 "March on Rome"

 ITA_crush_northern_opposition_desc:0 "The Bolsheviks of the North cannot recognize that their time has passed.

They have chosen their side, and we will be happy to make the streets run as red as their putrid banners."
 ITA_consolidate_power:0 "Consolidate Power"
 ITA_consolidate_power_desc:0 "The movement can never be stopped by any means. The Bolsheviks will be crushed underfoot by our legions of new Blackshirts, all marching gloriously forward led on by Duce Romagnoli.

 ITA_make_graziani_proud_desc:0 "A loyal ally of Benito Mussolini and a follower of the Social Republic, Rodolfo Graziani would not be proud of the current state of Italy's army.

Italy won’t just turn on a dime, and if we reform at the pace that these infantile cretins advocate, we will only run our country into the ground.

 ITA_invite_europe_desc:0 "Europe may be the red continent, but most of these reds are of the Communist variant, who aren’t exactly prime material for our International.

 ITA_amalfi:0 "Amalfi"
 ITA_amalfi_desc:0 "For a brief period in time, Amalfi was the economic powerhouse of the Italian Republics.

 ITA_work_with_socialists_desc:0 "Our newer and fairer Italy cannot be created by the hand of the Pope alone. Allies in the political establishment must be found.

 ITA_a_proper_wage:0 "A Proper Wage"
 ITA_a_proper_wage_desc:0 "Workers have been oppressed by Rome for too long, as the Communist government underpaid and overworked the self-same workers they claimed to represent. With a true workers’ party in power, the time has come to give onto the people what is the people’s, instead of Caesar taking it all."
 ITA_decentralised_military:0 "Decentralised Military"
 ITA_decentralised_military_desc:0 "An overwhelming military should not be a priority for any socialist nation. Instead, our armed forces should be dedicated to protecting their homes, so that they may fight in wars and then beat their swords into ploughshares when the fighting is done."
 ITA_federal_rights:0 "Federal Rights"
 ITA_federal_rights_desc:0 ""Every Italian citizen has rights. What was at best overlooked by the former Communist government will now be enshrined and upheld as the foundation of our rule, for if all people are deserving of dignity then they deserve a government that protects their civil liberties."
 ITA_protect_the_people:0 "Protect the People"
 ITA_protect_the_people_desc:0 "No outsiders can harm our people. Italy should not embark on grand, cross-continental offensives, we should just protect those that call Italy their home. Every inch of ground lost would be a concession to the enemies of our people, and is thus unacceptable."
 ITA_anti_corruption_campaign:0 "Anti-Corruption Campaign"
 ITA_anti_corruption_campaign_desc:0 "Under [Root.GetLeader] the Mafia's corruption and influence won't be here much longer. The weeds of corruption will be ripped up by the roots, and in their place we shall plant the trees of prosperity. With the Church on our side, it is only a matter of time before our land has been cleansed."
 ITA_catholic_alliance:0 "Catholic Alliance"
 ITA_catholic_alliance_desc:0 "Pope Francis paved the way for our rise to power. He and all Catholics must be given the recognition they deserve, for Christianity and socialism are but two sides of the same coin.

 ITA_open_the_borders_desc:0 "The gates of the Garden of Eden may have been shut to humanity, but we see no reason to not open our gates to those scores of refugees who are just looking for a place to live.

 ITA_rehabilitate_refugees:0 "Rehabilitate Refugees"
 ITA_rehabilitate_refugees_desc:0 "Refugees are helpless souls who need to be welcomed with open arms. For before us, there is neither Libyan nor Italian, there is just people, all yearning for a better future for themselves and their families. If we can live hand in hand, we will all benefit."

 ITA_more_welfare_desc:0 "The welfare state is beneficial, not harmful. Basic human needs should of course be sated, for so long as one person is left hungry, or unclothed, or homeless, our state will have failed. We can, no we must do better for the people that depend on us."
 ITA_farewell_eu:0 "Farewell EU"
 ITA_farewell_eu_desc:0 "We can no longer remain observers within the European Union. That symbol of Soviet domination over Europe fits us ill, and their ever more scathing critiques of our fair and righteous rule fits us ill.

 ITA_south_tyrol_or_war_desc:0 "Yet another sign of how the European Union cared little for the will of the people, the people of Alto Adige were forced to live under German domain, with no say in their fate. The Germans will hand over Alto Adige... or there will be catastrophic consequences."
 ITA_a_firm_hand:0 "A Firm Hand"
 ITA_a_firm_hand_desc:0 "Italy needs a firm hand to keep itself in check. Communist degeneracy almost ruined the moral spirit of the Italian people, and only the iron fist of the vicar of Christ on Earth will be able to correct these failings of our people, and compel the sinners to repent."
 ITA_restore_order_outside_rome:0 "Restore Order Outside Rome"
 ITA_restore_order_outside_rome_desc:0 "Outside of Rome there is chaos. Pope Pius can guide us in the right direction to eliminating opposition to his divine rule.

 ITA_pius_youth:0 "Pius Youth"
 ITA_pius_youth_desc:0 "The youth of our nation must be indoctrinated to ensure stability and security in the future.

 ITA_crush_atheist_organisations_desc:0 "Atheists are attempting to brainwash our impressionable younger generations. This cannot be permitted.

 ITA_limited_privatisation:0 "Limited Privatisation"
 ITA_limited_privatisation_desc:0 "Even though a planned economy is a soulless endeavour, crushing all human spirit beneath the grinding wheels of the bureaucratic machinery, Rome should still control some aspects of the economy at least. Only then can we prevent the greed of Mammon from overtaking our nation."
 ITA_military_industry_push:0 "Military Industry Push"
 ITA_military_industry_push_desc:0 "To ensure the strength of our military, more industrial zones should be constructed throughout the Papal State. Faith may be a potent weapon against enemies of the spirit, but against enemies of the flesh, guns and tanks prove infinitely more capable."

 ITA_crusader_morale_desc:0 "Soon the Pope shall call a crusade against the heretics. The faithful must be readied, prepared to give up the ultimate sacrifice for the true faith.

 ITA_the_old_deus_vult:0 "The Old Deus Vult"
 ITA_the_old_deus_vult_desc:0 "For more than a millennia, the faith of the crescent has been our chief enemy.

 ITA_the_new_deus_vult:0 "The New Deus Vult"
 ITA_the_new_deus_vult_desc:0 "Islam may have been the enemy of the Church once, but today a new enemy has reared its head: Communism. This red scourge is the latest of satanic plots to overthrow the Church, and it even managed to do so for a time, taking the homeplace of the Church itself under its domain. For the Holy Church to be safe, Communism must be exterminated."
 ITA_call_on_catholic_nations:0 "Call on Catholic Nations"
 ITA_call_on_catholic_nations_desc:0 "Once, all Catholic heeded our calls when crusades were declared, and they surely will again.

Martyrdom will be promised to all who fall, as ever more of the World is claimed for the Church."
 ITA_call_on_nationalists:0 "Call on Nationalists"
 ITA_call_on_nationalists_desc:0 "With a new enemy comes new allies. Many of the countries aligned against the Communist menace are not Catholic, but yet they may prove faithful allies yet. Communism is not just a threat to the Holy Church, but also to every other system of belief on Earth. A common accord with other faithful can surely be reached."

 ITA_the_latin_language_desc:0 "For far too long, the divide between the people and the Holy Church has only caused division and schism, as false prophets have been able to fraudulently paint the Church as elitist.

 ITA_amnesty_to_the_dons:0 "Amnesty to the Dons"
 ITA_amnesty_to_the_dons_desc:0 "Perhaps the Mafia isn't necessarily a drain on our state. While their business definitely is not completely legal, the Mafia is so deeply ingrained into Italian society that it might be better to ally with them than to persecute them. After all, even the Mafiosos take communion in God’s holy church."
 ITA_glory_to_italia:0 "Glory to Italia"
 ITA_glory_to_italia_desc:0 "Italia is the homeplace of the church, and long need you look to find a more pious and fervent people, loyal and devoted to the Church!

 ITA_root_out_separatism:0 "Root Out Separatism"
 ITA_root_out_separatism_desc:0 "Even as the atheist scourge of Communism departs our land, another siren song threatens to lead our people astray.

 ITA_limited_trade:0 "Limited Trade"

 ITA_purge_liberation_theologists:0 "Purge Liberation Theologists"
 ITA_purge_liberation_theologists_desc:0 "Liberation theologists have no idea what Catholicism and the words of Jesus himself mean. Their closeness to the Socialists have clouded their judgments, polluted their faith with the twin sins of atheism and materialism. They must be shown the truth of our Lord and the error of their way, but also kept from leading any more of our flock astray."
 ITA_italianisation_programs:0 "Italianisation"
 ITA_italianisation_programs_desc:0 "The Italian Union's communist government attempted to crush our culture and way of life, in favour of multiculturalism. Where they tried to instigate separation and division shall we sow the seeds of communion and unity, for before Christ there is neither Greek nor Jew, and so will there before us neither be Libyan nor Tyrol-German, for all are one within Italy."

 ITA_go_it_alone:0 "Go It Alone"
 ITA_go_it_alone_desc:0 "To entangle ourselves in foreign endeavours is to invite worldly concerns into our government, and those who are of the world cannot be of the lord.

 ITA_invite_south_america:0 "Invite South America"
 ITA_invite_south_america_desc:0 "The centre of Catholicism is increasingly shifting towards South America.

 ITA_invite_central_america:0 "Invite Central America"
 ITA_invite_central_america_desc:0 "Central America is home to hundreds of millions of faithful, but their faith is under threat from the Communists in Nicaragua, who have already swept up so many faithful within their realm.

 ITA_new_risorgimento_desc:0 "The mafia harm our ability to unite Italy, but like the unruly regional princes that kept us from uniting the country before, they shall fall before our might.

 ITA_crackdown_on_northern_republicanism_desc:0 "The North is notably anti-Monarchist. Something has to change over there.

 ITA_strong_identity:0 "Strong Identity"
 ITA_strong_identity_desc:0 "A strong Roman identity, rather than an Italian one, will help us consolidate power over the nation. Italy was merely one national pretender to Rome, one that only unites people on the peninsula.

 ITA_reinstate_slavery:0 "Reinstate Slavery"
 ITA_reinstate_slavery_desc:0 "From an economic view, enslaving the refugees arriving in the thousands from Libya would be greatly beneficial. For those who yamper and complain incessantly, who cares about such notions as ‘human rights’? Rome was the pinnacle of human civilisation, and Rome did not hold such delusional liberal notions. As such, slavery is not just a beneficial but also morally justified decision. The strong rule the weak."
 ITA_rebirth_of_latin:0 "Rebirth of Latin"
 ITA_rebirth_of_latin_desc:0 "Soon the Italian language will be long gone. In its place Latin shall reign supreme. Latin was the first Lingua Franca, and it will become so again, when all of Europe is unified under the Roman aquila, the one that lets all of Europe's disparate peoples communicate."

 ITA_claim_germania:0 "Claim Germania"
 ITA_claim_germania_desc:0 "The age old arch-enemy waits on the other side of the Rhine river. The Germans once struck when Rome was at its weakest, and set back human progress by several centuries.

 ITA_claim_dalmatia:0 "Claim Dalmatia"

 ITA_claim_macedonia:0 "Claim Macedonia"
 ITA_claim_macedonia_desc:0 "Never have there been a people more worthy of calling themselves Roman than the Greeks! Even as our civilisation fell in the West did they do their utmost to keep it alive in the east, until that fateful day in 1453 when the last bastion of Roman civilisation fell.

 ITA_claim_syria_desc:0 "In the days of the first Empire, Syria was the little brother to Egypt, likewise feeding many mouths across the empire.

 ITA_claim_moesia:0 "Claim Moesia"
 ITA_claim_moesia_desc:0 "For the Roman East, Moesia was a bulwark, one that shielded our prosperous Mediterranean cities from the barbarians of the Steppes. While Huns, Cumans and Tatars have all come and gone, danger yet rears its ugly head from the Eurasian Steppe. It is imperative that our bulwark is restored, and that the Danube once again becomes a Roman wall."
 ITA_claim_dacia:0 "Claim Dacia"
 ITA_claim_dacia_desc:0 "Just because Moesia shields our Mediterranean provinces doesn’t mean we have to stop there. Just north of the Danube, a people of Romans have made their home.

 AMC_develop_self_sufficiency_desc:0 "Autarky is a plausible concept for our nation, whilst we are relatively small compared to our ideological enemies across our border, this will make it easier to enforce autarky and finally achieve self-sufficiency. After all, why should we rely on others when we can easily supply ourselves?"
 AMC_mandatory_conscription:0 "Mandatory Conscription"
 AMC_mandatory_conscription_desc:0 "Devotion to the state will be instilled into the values of our children, and as they grow we shall promote the military to them ensuring that we have fresh recruits ready to serve their nation and fight against all who wish to see harm come to our state. Therefore, to weed out the weak in our nation we shall begin to implement mandatory military service."
 AMC_consolidate_military_rule:0 "Consolidate Military Rule"
 AMC_consolidate_military_rule_desc:0 "The military is the only institution that the state needs. Democracy is easily susceptible to the horrific ideologies of socialism and communism and therefore it is a danger to our society. All that remains now is the military, and the people will be loyal to their great generals."

 AMC_mcdew_seizes_control_desc:0 "After much internal debate and infighting, the triumvirate has decided that in order to lead our nation towards a bright future we need a commander of the skies. Therefore, it has been decided that air force general Darren McDew will fly us out of our present situation and towards success."
 AMC_defend_the_skies:0 "Defend the Skies"
 AMC_defend_the_skies_desc:0 "To defend our populace from the terror of bombing campaigns, General McDew has diverted funds towards the development of anti-air turrets within all major cities and towns across the nation. Doing so will ensure that not a single bomber reaches the capital and that our planes dominate the skies."
 AMC_aircraft_production_plan:0 "Aircraft Production Plan"
 AMC_aircraft_production_plan_desc:0 "In order to defend our skies we must have planes, air defences are fine but will not be able to stop the enemies air force entirely. Therefore, we must build up our own air force by building factories across the nation that will focus solely on the production of aircraft."
 AMC_advanced_planes:0 "Advanced Planes"
 AMC_advanced_planes_desc:0 "With our production of an air force now well underway, the only thing stopping our dominance of the skies is outdated technology. We will not be able to properly defend our skies using technology from the early 2000s. We must develop newer and faster planes should we truly wish to dominate our skies."
 AMC_sky_warfare:0 "Sky Warfare"
 AMC_sky_warfare_desc:0 "Since the First World War, the air war has always decided who will win a battle. Having control of the air usually ends in a victory and therefore the tactics our pilots use when dogfighting, bombing or attacking enemy positions are vital to our success. We should look at beginning to modernise our tactics and hope that it will be enough to secure our dominance over the skies."
 AMC_mcconville_seizes_control:0 "McConville Seizes Control"
 AMC_mcconville_seizes_control_desc:0 "After much internal debate and infighting, the triumvirate has decided that in order to lead our nation towards a bright future we need a true military commander, not a pilot or admiral.

 AMC_arm_every_border:0 "Arm Every Border"
 AMC_arm_every_border_desc:0 "We have enough men to guard both our border with Canada and the People’s Commonwealth.

 AMC_modern_foot_soldiers:0 "Modern Foot Soldiers"
 AMC_modern_foot_soldiers_desc:0 "Our troops are the very thing defending us against an invasion from Canada or the People’s Commonwealth, our recent push for modernisation of equipment was a resounding success. However, it can always go further. There will always be new guns and equipment that we need to fight against our enemies, and we should continue to develop these new weapons."
 AMC_advanced_vehicles:0 "Advanced Vehicles"
 AMC_advanced_vehicles_desc:0 "The use of trucks and other vehicles during warfare was made popular during the First World War, as they are quicker than regular infantry they can easily lead the spearhead deep into enemy lines and cause chaos for enemy supplies. We should invest in updating these trucks and carriers so that they are faster and can carry more troops around the battlefield. Doing so will give us an edge over our foe."
 AMC_tactics_on_land:0 "Tactics on Land"
 AMC_tactics_on_land_desc:0 "The war with the People’s Commonwealth revealed the flaws in our doctrine, and we should work to improve it.

 AMC_enact_immediate_economic_reforms_desc:0 "The country is in dire need of reform and repair. For too long the People’s Commonwealth has drained and deprived New England of any liberty.

 AMC_reverse_collectivisation:0 "Reverse Collectivisation"
 AMC_reverse_collectivisation_desc:0 "One of the first major crimes of the People’s Commonwealth was collectivisation. Thousands of people unnecessarily worked in harsh conditions all for the sake of increased production rates. Reversing this policy will increase productivity in our agriculture and it will also free the people of the tyrannical practices found on these farms."
 AMC_get_them_working:0 "Get Them Working"
 AMC_get_them_working_desc:0 "Now more than ever we need our workers in the factory. We understand that many are celebrating our independence and our veterans are spending time with their families. But, life must return to normal and our factories cannot remain empty forever. Therefore, our people must return to the factories and restart the economy."
 AMC_power_to_the_media:0 "Power to the Media"
 AMC_power_to_the_media_desc:0 "Under the People’s Commonwealth, the media was used as nothing more than a tool to prop up the government. No longer, the people have a right to criticise their governments and so does the media. We shall grant the press unlimited freedom, opening our government up to scrutiny and creating the beginnings of a democratic society."
 AMC_a_new_american_dream:0 "A New American Dream"
 AMC_a_new_american_dream_desc:0 "The old American dream died kicking and screaming, it has no place in our society or our government as it was all a lie, the people were never truly free under the old American system. Therefore, we shall create our own American dream, one based off of the founding principles of the revolution. Equality, Freedom and Democracy."
 AMC_democracy_in_our_military:0 "Democracy in Our Military"
 AMC_democracy_in_our_military_desc:0 "One thing we can agree with the People’s Commonwealth on is that democracy within the army is vital for a thriving and decentralised army. Whilst it became clear that this democracy was ending when the Central Committee took over, we can still maintain the policy ourselves to allow our troops the ability to elect their officers."
 AMC_strong_judiciary:0 "Strong Judiciary"

 AMC_thriving_populace_desc:0 "Now that we have staved off the potential economic collapse of the nation by reviving our resource industries. The people across the nation now have some hope that there is a future beyond our initial economic troubles. With support from our populace, thousands are now returning to work and factories are expanding across the country."
 AMC_unite_behind_bernies_dream:0 "Unite Behind Bernie's Dream"
 AMC_unite_behind_bernies_dream_desc:0 "The legacy left behind by Bernie Sanders was one our nation can rally behind. His untimely death broke the hearts of many who had wished to see him carry our nation forward under the banner of democracy. However, this was not to be. Now under President Sotomayor, the nation rallies behind Bernie’s dream for a democratic society."
 AMC_northern_initiative:0 "Northern Initiative"
 AMC_northern_initiative_desc:0 "The north of New England, specifically Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire, has always been neglected by the People’s Commonwealth and its present downtrodden state only proves that. We should invest in the north of our country and bring rapid industrialisation to those living there."
 AMC_southern_initiative:0 "Southern Initiative"
 AMC_southern_initiative_desc:0 "Whilst the south of our nation was always looked after more than the north by the Commonwealth, we should continue to expand industries within the south rather than forcing the north to industrialise."
 AMC_third_american_revolution:0 "Third American Revolution"
 AMC_third_american_revolution_desc:0 "The first American revolution was fought in the 18th century, the second in the 20th and now the third in the 21st.

 AMC_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Conscription"
 AMC_mass_conscription_desc:0 "If we are to have serious convictions about winning this war, then all must serve in our army. To win the support of our people we must promote to the people the future that awaits them after the revolution has been won. We must defeat the authoritarian menace of the Central Committee, if liberty is to triumph."
 AMC_from_farmers_to_soldiers:0 "From Farmers to Soldiers"
 AMC_from_farmers_to_soldiers_desc:0 "Our revolution began in one of the largest agricultural areas of the People’s Commonwealth, and therefore most of our conscripts are not used to warfare. In order to win this war, we do not need farmers, we need soldiers, and we shall begin to turn our ploughshares into swords."
 AMC_defend_strategic_points:0 "Defend Strategic Points"
 AMC_defend_strategic_points_desc:0 "As the war continues we have now developed an understanding of how our foe’s military works.

With our generals passing this knowledge onto our troops we can better defend occupied towns and cities."
 AMC_foreign_aid:0 "Foreign Aid"
 AMC_foreign_aid_desc:0 "In order for our revolution to be successful, we need the support of nations across the free world.

 AMC_revolutionary_propaganda:0 "Revolutionary Propaganda"
 AMC_revolutionary_propaganda_desc:0 "In order to ensure that our soldiers know what they are fighting for it has become necessary to produce propaganda that demonstrates what awaits them should we win the war and what awaits them should we fail.

 AMC_behind_enemy_lines:0 "Behind Enemy Lines"
 AMC_behind_enemy_lines_desc:0 "As the revolution continues, more people have become sympathetic to our cause and are willing to rise up against their tyrannical oppressors.

 AMC_quick_planning_desc:0 "In order for our forces to successfully beat back the Committee traitors, we must be ready at a moment's notice.

 AMC_victory_at_last_desc:0 "The revolution is over and we are victorious! Our forces have defeated the Committee loyalists, and we have restored peace to the north-east!

 AMC_the_presidents_plan:0 "The President's Plan"
 AMC_the_presidents_plan_desc:0 "Whilst the General’s plan is tempting we cannot become the very thing we swore to destroy. If we are to truly move beyond the Central Committee’s way, then we must begin the plan of President Sotomayor, focusing on reconciliation rather than humiliation."
 AMC_national_reconciliation_convention:0 "National Reconciliation Convention"
 AMC_national_reconciliation_convention_desc:0 "The old Central Committee was not filled with traitors to the people, some members were merely doing what they thought was right whilst remaining blissfully unaware of the goings-on of the higher-ups. We should invite members of the Committee to the National Reconciliation Convention where we shall work with them to come to a compromise and put our differences behind us."
 AMC_create_a_provisional_congress:0 "Create a Provisional Congress"
 AMC_create_a_provisional_congress_desc:0 "In order to effectively deal with the Committee’s grasp over the nation, we should establish a provisional congress that will invite members from all across the country to represent their region and notify the congress on how to best deal with remnants of the Committee. Whilst an arduous task, the end result will see the nation finally move on from the Committee’s authoritarian nature."
 AMC_dissolve_trade_councils:0 "Dissolve Trade Councils"
 AMC_dissolve_trade_councils_desc:0 "The unions have always held significant influence over the politics of the nation, and whilst we are not opposed to Trade Unions, we do oppose their present widespread influence over the political establishment. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the influence of the Trade Unions by dissolving the Trade Councils present in every state."

 AMC_reorganise_executive_branches_desc:0 "In order to ensure that the old ideology of the Central Committee is eradicated from our government forever, we must begin to reorganise the main executive branches of our government.

 AMC_replace_military_apparatus:0 "Replace Military Apparatus"
 AMC_replace_military_apparatus_desc:0 "The military has, for the time being, served its purpose, and we have less need for factories solely focusing on the production of armaments.

 AMC_democratic_principles:0 "Democratic Principles"
 AMC_democratic_principles_desc:0 "No more shall the tyrannical ways of the Central Committee plague our great society. America was founded off of the principle of democracy, and we shall continue this tradition. The values of the old regime will be denounced, and we shall instead work to bring about compromise in our new democratic society."
 AMC_restart_farming:0 "Restart Farming"
 AMC_restart_farming_desc:0 "Our farmers have been lacking in support recently if we are to avoid widespread famine, we should begin handing out subsidies to struggling farms in order to restart their industry and prevent the beginning of a famine. Alongside this restarting our agricultural sector will allow us to trade excess produce abroad, opening our nation to trade from much of the world."
 AMC_the_generals_plan:0 "The General's Plan"
 AMC_the_generals_plan_desc:0 "Despite what President Sotomayor has been offering, reconciliation will only let the treacherous Central Committee remain within our society and influence the highest ranks of our government. Instead, we should follow General Joseph Dunford’s plan, which believes that the only way to secure our revolution is through humiliation and subjugation of all Committee loyalists."
 AMC_indoctrinate_enemy_soldiers:0 "Indoctrinate Enemy Soldiers"
 AMC_indoctrinate_enemy_soldiers_desc:0 "Former Central Committee loyalists must become loyal to our cause. To do so we shall begin the process of rehabilitation... Soon these Central Committee loyalists shall sing the song of revolution, but not the songs of their old masters, rather they shall reject socialism in its entirety and swear absolute loyalty to their new masters."
 AMC_execute_committee_traitors:0 "Execute Committee Traitors"
 AMC_execute_committee_traitors_desc:0 "The Central Committee was full of treacherous leeches and no matter where one looked, all who were involved had a part to play in the machine of oppression. Therefore, it is necessary to make an example of the leading figures of the Central Committee. We shall broadcast their execution across the nation, reminding any remaining loyalists of the fate that awaits them."
 AMC_controlled_judiciary:0 "Controlled Judiciary"
 AMC_controlled_judiciary_desc:0 "The judiciary will become an extension of the government. It will be loyal to our ideals and persecute all who oppose the new government. Only this way will the nation be secure from the threat of the Central Committee and any other organisation wishing to destroy our glorious state."
 AMC_maintain_a_war_economy:0 "Maintain a War Economy"
 AMC_maintain_a_war_economy_desc:0 "The economy is presently booming thanks to the civil war, it would be a shame to see efficiency and production output drop because we stop with our present economic model. The economy shall continue to operate as if we were at war, and our economy shall continue to boom because of this decision."
 AMC_pushed_to_the_edge:0 "Pushed to the Edge"
 AMC_pushed_to_the_edge_desc:0 "The people must continue to work as hard as they can in order for our economy to prosper. What does it matter if a few workers die due to being overworked and poor conditions within factories? We can always replace these people with new workers, who will no doubt work harder than those who came before them."
 AMC_figurehead_president:0 "Figurehead President"
 AMC_figurehead_president_desc:0 "President Sotomayor must remain as a figurehead for the nation, she has guided us well up until now and her removal from office would no doubt cause more problems than it would benefits. She will remain as little more than a rubber stamp for all of our policies. However, true authority over the nation will reside within the military clique."
 AMC_american_junta:0 "American Junta"
 AMC_american_junta_desc:0 "President Sotomayor is no longer needed. She has served her purpose, and we can now replace her. Now we shall elect a new leader, a stronger leader, one who will not allow our tragedy to continue. With General Dunford’s appointment, this is how American liberty dies, with thunderous applause."
 AMC_prepare_the_army:0 "Prepare the Army"

 AMC_prepare_the_air_force:0 "Prepare the Air Force"
 AMC_prepare_the_air_force_desc:0 "The air force is a vital part of our army and without it, we would struggle to make advancements along the front line. Therefore, we must ready it for our inevitable march against the rest of America. Our pilots will train harder than before, and we shall continue to develop our strategies for attacking enemy positions and planes."
 AMC_prepare_the_navy:0 "Prepare the Navy"
 AMC_prepare_the_navy_desc:0 "The navy is our last line of defence against any wishing to invade behind our lines and cause havoc with the redeployment of troops in the battlefield. Whilst our navy is small we will nevertheless begin training it so it may be ready for the inevitable conflict it will face during times of war."
 AMC_american_seas:0 "American Seas"

 AMC_links_to_the_church:0 "Links to the Church"
 AMC_links_to_the_church_desc:0 "The Habsburgs have always been closely associated with the Papacy. However, with the Pope’s exile to Spain, the influence of the Papacy has all but diminished in North America.

 AMC_enlist_for_your_king:0 "Enlist for Your King"
 AMC_enlist_for_your_king_desc:0 "To live and die for the King should be seen as the greatest honour for our citizens. By investing in propaganda campaigning for the military we shall see thousands more well-bodied and capable men ready to die for their monarch. With this newly emboldened love for the crown, our forces will fight harder for their nation and die knowing that their service to Imre will never be forgotten."
 AMC_build_up_defences:0 "Build Up Defences"
 AMC_build_up_defences_desc:0 "The defence of the nation remains one of the most important policies of our kingdom, with the Central Committee still posing a threat to our very existence we should divert funds from less important sectors of the economy into the defence of the nation. Doing so will allow for a temporary improvement into the construction of much-needed fortifications along the border with our foe."
 AMC_decrease_wages:0 "Decrease Wages"
 AMC_decrease_wages_desc:0 "The King’s subjects have been living too luxuriously in recent times, the policies of the former socialist traitors aimed at increasing wages for all in order to maintain a 'liveable wage.' There is no such need for such a wage and, if anything, the people’s wages should be decreased so that our King may have more money to spend on other more important matters."
 AMC_neglect_popular_needs:0 "Neglect Popular Needs"
 AMC_neglect_popular_needs_desc:0 "With wages having been reduced, the next part of the King’s plan to raise money is to avoid certain 'basic necessities' that the people supposedly need in order to have a decent life. Whilst the people may complain that they have lost out on welfare programs, healthcare and large swathes of agricultural land that the King has now repossessed as his own, their complaints are unimportant."
 AMC_cult_of_personality:0 "Cult of Personality"
 AMC_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Ever since his invitation to lead our nation, King Imre has always been the figurehead of the nation. The people have recognised his authority and accepted that he is the nation. King Imre is New England, and New England is King Imre. There is no other institution or individual more worthy of praise than Imre. God save the King of New England. God save Imre I."
 AMC_limited_scientific_advancement:0 "Limited Scientific Advancement"
 AMC_limited_scientific_advancement_desc:0 "Modern science has been infiltrated by communists and other revolutionaries who would seek to have Imre’s head on a spike. Therefore, it has no place here in our kingdom. The only science we need here in our glorious land is that of God’s word. God has guided us before and will guide us even further into the future, rather than these revolutionary scientists."
 AMC_claim_greater_new_england:0 "Claim Greater New England"
 AMC_claim_greater_new_england_desc:0 "Our kingdom is far too small in order for King Imre to properly protect the interests of Catholicism in North America. Simply put New England cannot be confined to this pitiful space of land. New Brunswick is a majority Catholic region and Nova Scotia has an ever-increasing Catholic presence, these two provinces would be better off in our hands than the Canadians."
 AMC_demand_canadian_provinces:0 "Demand Canadian Provinces"
 AMC_demand_canadian_provinces_desc:0 "New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are calling out to be welcomed into our Kingdom, and we are all but ready to accept them as subjects of King Imre. However, there is only one thing standing in our way. The Canadian government may not be willing to hand over these regions and if they do not then our kingdom stands ready to take these regions by force if we have to."
 AMC_bermuda_trade:0 "Bermuda Trade"
 AMC_bermuda_trade_desc:0 "The British have not had a need for Bermuda since the collapse of their empire. As of now, this island is more American than British and therefore we have every right to ask the British for this territory. We do not wish to spark conflict over such a small island and therefore are more than willing to pay for the island. Hopefully the British see reason and cave to our demands."
 AMC_welfare_monarchy:0 "Welfare Monarchy"
 AMC_welfare_monarchy_desc:0 "Welfare was a founding principle of the People’s Commonwealth and our Commonwealth and repealing such an important aspect of people’s lives will do nothing more than upset the populace. We should not repeal welfare provisions and instead should focus on expanding welfare, providing for the people and rising above the People’s Commonwealth in provisions for our people."
 AMC_democratic_privy_council:0 "Democratic Privy Council"
 AMC_democratic_privy_council_desc:0 "Whilst we are an absolute monarchy, it is important that we do not neglect the democratic principles America was founded on. By allowing the people to elect members of the King’s privy council we can maintain our legitimacy as an absolute monarchy and give the people the illusion that they still have control over the political goings-on of our nation."
 AMC_world_trade_initiative:0 "World Trade Initiative"
 AMC_world_trade_initiative_desc:0 "There is no need for us to shut off trade with the world. Our small kingdom would never be able to become self-sufficient no matter how hard we tried to implement autarkic policies. Therefore, we shall open up to the world and begin the mass import and export of goods."
 AMC_stand_by_the_red_and_white:0 "Stand by the Red and White"
 AMC_stand_by_the_red_and_white_desc:0 "There are some in our nation who wish the King to expand beyond our present borders, claiming that New England is destined for greatness and that through expansion we can achieve this. However, the King has rejected such claims, stating that New England is our home, and we should be proud to live here."
 AMC_proclaim_new_france:0 "Proclaim New France"
 AMC_proclaim_new_france_desc:0 "There are those who argue that our kingdom should not expand beyond its present borders. However, our King has seen otherwise.

 AMC_reconciliation_with_the_commonwealth:0 "Reconciliation With the Commonwealth"
 AMC_reconciliation_with_the_commonwealth_desc:0 "The Commonwealth has been relatively quiet towards us, other than a few spies attempting to cross the border. Rather than allow our relations to remain soured, the King has seen it to be beneficial for both our nations to begin reconciliation. With the two of us coming to a mutual understanding, peace may finally be achieved in New England."
 AMC_growing_oligarchy:0 "Growing Oligarchy"
 AMC_growing_oligarchy_desc:0 "Having an oligarchy surrounding the monarchy will benefit the nation’s economy after all corporations know more about how to effectively run the nation than elected officials. With the oligarchs at the side of the Queen, our nation will develop rapidly and soon the people will realise that the Queen is doing all in her power to strengthen the country."
 AMC_new_england_security_agency:0 "New England Security Agency"
 AMC_new_england_security_agency_desc:0 "The people have a right to feel safe, and by establishing the New England Security Agency we can begin to crack down on spies attempting to enter the nation and keep a closer eye on our neighbours. This agency will benefit us all and the people will only need to fear it should they have something to hide."
 AMC_take_no_precautions:0 "Take No Precuations"
 AMC_take_no_precautions_desc:0 "Having access to a nuclear arsenal will keep our enemies afraid of us, should we ever develop a nuclear warhead we would not hesitate to use such a devastating weapon.

 AMC_metropolis_boston_desc:0 "Boston, one of the largest cities in our kingdom, must be transformed from its downtrodden state into a glorious metropolis fit for her royal highness to visit.

 AMC_fitzgerald_seizes_control_desc:0 "After much internal debate and infighting, the triumvirate has decided that in order to lead our nation towards a bright future we need a commander of the seas. Therefore, it has been decided that Admiral Mark Fitzgerald will lead us forward and guide us through the storm."
 AMC_prepare_coastal_defences:0 "Prepare Coastal Defences"
 AMC_prepare_coastal_defences_desc:0 "Our army is already well-trained enough to deal with any immediate threat to our borders. Our main issue comes from the seas, our navy would not be able to stop a naval invasion of our coasts and therefore, Admiral Fitzgerald has deemed it necessary to focus our military expenditure on large coastal defences which will repel even the strongest of foes."
 AMC_new_england_shipyards:0 "New England Shipyards"
 AMC_new_england_shipyards_desc:0 "Our navy is still lacking in strength, by expanding existing harbours and dockyards we will be able to increase the size of our navy and reduce our dependence upon our recently constructed coastal defences. If we can build a large enough navy, our dominance of the seas will be secured and all will bow before our mighty fleet!"
 AMC_advanced_vessels:0 "Advanced Vessels"
 AMC_advanced_vessels_desc:0 "Despite the increase in the size of our fleet, we must remember that quantity does not mean dominance. Dominance of the seas comes from the quality of the ships within the fleet. By developing modern designs for our fleets, the navy will finally become the ruler of the seas and triumph over all other nations' navies."
 AMC_revived_admiralty:0 "Revived Admiralty"
 AMC_revived_admiralty_desc:0 "Our naval doctrines are quite obviously outdated. If we are to truly become masters of the sea and defend our land with our mighty fleet, then it is vital that our doctrines are not based on conflicts from the Cold War. By studying old conflicts, we will be able to see where the admirals of the past failed and how we can improve our own tactics."
 AMC_tyranny_of_the_military:0 "Tyranny of the Military"
 AMC_tyranny_of_the_military_desc:0 "The people have all but accepted our leadership, those who have not are being dealt with as traitors to our nation. The junta is all the people need, and we will not step down from our position without a fight. The military will guide this nation forward, not some democratically elected officials who have time and again been revealed as ineffective. We shall not have a repeat of Reagan."

 AMC_benevolence_of_the_military_desc:0 "Whilst we are a dictatorship there is no reason as to why we can not be peaceful towards all those loyal to us.

 CSD_disperse_riots: "Disperse The Riots"
 CSD_disperse_riots_desc: "Across the nation, thousands have descended onto the streets to demand the return of the former democratic government. To ensure that these anarchists remain pacified the police must intervene and crackdown on these rebellions ensuring the survival of the new Stencel government."
 CSD_abolish_parliament: "Abolish Parliament"
 CSD_abolish_parliament_desc: "The only reason Cascadia is rife with anarchy is due to the failure of parliament to ensure a clear line of succession following former President Stine’s death. In order to ensure that such chaos can never destroy our nation again parliament is to be dissolved, permanently, only through its dissolution can Cascadia prosper and recover from anarchy."
 CSD_martial_law: "Declare Martial Law"
 CSD_martial_law_desc: "Despite the efforts of our increased police presence, rioters across the nation continue to protest against our government, demanding the restoration of democracy.

 CSD_seize_airwaves_desc: "With our recent coup against the failed government of President Stine, it is vital to ensure that our rule is maintained and that the people recognise who is truly in charge of Cascadia. To ensure the people are aware of this, our government must dominate the airwaves and broadcast the truth about the failed former government."
 CSD_junta_rule: "Junta Rule"
 CSD_junta_rule_desc: "General Stencel has determined that if Cascadia is to prosper it must be under his own rule, whilst concessions to the corporations will still be given the nation will remain under his control with all branches of the government responding directly to him."
 CSD_orecorp_rule: "OreCorp Rule"
 CSD_orecorp_rule_desc: "Michael Stencel is, first and foremost, a military man, and, despite his strong convictions, he isn’t cut out for the day-to-day intricacies of politics and economics. OreCorp, on the other hand, is a vast apparatus, full of the exact expertise and resources needed to run a country. Plus, it will be a fitting reward for the indispensable help in overthrowing Stine."
 CSD_expand_mining_projects: "Expand Mining Projects"
 CSD_expand_mining_projects_desc: "For Cascadia to prosper it must become self-sufficient through the expansion of our limited mining projects, and the repeal of legislation that restricts our mining capabilities, Cascadia may soon prosper and the riches of the Earth shall soon be within our industries hands."
 CSD_cascadian_movement: "Co-opt The Cascadian Movement"
 CSD_cascadian_movement_desc: "The initial revolt against the communists was one of nationalist fervour that had been reinforced from decades of neglect under the communist system.

 CSD_national_executive: "Keep the National Executive"
 CSD_national_executive_desc: "If Cascadia is to prosper then it must not be run by a so-called Board of Shareholders, such an organisation would merely fall into the bureaucracy that the former parliament had.

 CSD_new_order: "The New Order"
 CSD_new_order_desc: "Now that the situation has calmed and the new regime has been consolidated, the future of Cascadia must be determined. Currently, Stencel holds all the power, and could easily elect to retain full control of the nation. However, the OreCorp figures who assisted this regime’s creation have maintained steady pressure to hand over power to the corporation."
 CSD_industrial_megaprojects: "Industrial Megaprojects"
 CSD_industrial_megaprojects_desc: "For Cascadian industry to prosper, the nation must undergo rapid industrialisation and one such plan for this industrialisation is the rapid development of major towns and cities across Washington and Oregon.

 CSD_abolish_corporate_tax: "Abolish Corporate Taxation"

 CSD_contract_secret_police: "Contract Secret Police"
 CSD_contract_secret_police_desc: "Whilst the police are an extension of the state it is evident that private militias and police are far more effective in their methods due to their lack of accountability. By contracting these groups we can hope to continue the crackdown on our opposition and secure our control over the nation."
 CSD_canadian_links: "Entrench Canadian Links"
 CSD_canadian_links_desc: "Our Canadian brethren to the north have always understood that profits must come first, and by strengthening our ties to their nation we can develop our trade and become a useful ally to the Canadian government.

 CSD_national_investor_council_desc: "General Stencel’s ambition has long been at odds with many of the nation’s corporations, whilst his concessions have been well received he has recently shown to be too weak to continue his leadership.

 CSD_stencels_plan: "Stencel’s Plan"
 CSD_stencels_plan_desc: "Prime Minister Stencel has recently proposed a new economic plan that will continue to see the rapid development of the Cascadian military industry.

 CSD_technocratic_management: "Technocratic Management"
 CSD_technocratic_management_desc: "Within the economy, it is vital that those in charge are the best and brightest in their field and the Prime Minister has recognised this.

 CSD_privatize_state_lands: "Privatize The State Trust Lands"
 CSD_privatize_state_lands_desc: "Whilst the original Cascadian government had aimed to ensure the protection of the environment, through the establishment of state trust lands, it has become evident that these lands are an economic hindrance to the government and must be privatised to ensure continued economic prosperity. Whilst the ecologists may complain, businesses shall see a significant rise in land for sale."
 CSD_decentralized_economy: "Decentralize The Economy"
 CSD_decentralized_economy_desc: "The most fundamental rule of a market economy is that it operates at its best when it is left alone. There is no need for a government body to intervene, and doing so will only hamper the prosperity of the economy. Going forward, Cascadia’s economic policy will be changed to reflect this; the invisible hand will guide Cascadia’s economic futures."
 CSD_orecorp_economic_policies: "OreCorp’s Economic Policies"
 CSD_orecorp_economic_policies_desc: "With the seizure of power by Orecorp the new government can now work to enshrine its economic policies into everyday life.

 CSD_international_trade_desc: "Trade has been, and will always be, a vital aspect of the Cascadian economy in order to preserve this vital sector of economic growth our nation must be willing to trade with all those who are willing to do business with us.

 CSD_breaking_silience_desc: "For too long Cascadia has remained silent on the regional stage, to our east lie the decadent scum of the Lincolnites and the Montanans, to our north the Canadians and the south lie our old foe. No longer shall Cascadia remain silent, it is time to enter the global stage and make our presence known."
 CSD_lincolnites: "Take Down The Lincolnites"
 CSD_lincolnites_desc: "The first and most pressing threat to Cascadian independence lies in the east.

 CSD_attack_montana: "Attack Montana"
 CSD_attack_montana_desc: "Much like the Lincolnites, the Montanans are a threat to our existence, and cannot be allowed to continue to exert control over their small corner of America.

 CSD_militias_to_pmcs_desc: "With the capitulation of Montana, it has become evident that their defeat came from a severely underequipped and undertrained militia force, by reaching out to these militia groups and hiring them to patrol their former territory we may soon train them to be an effective fighting force."
 CSD_demleague_trade: "Democratic League Trade"
 CSD_demleague_trade_desc: "The Democratic League, especially Canada, remains a vital part of the Cascadian economy. Their trade with our nation has resulted in a drastic increase in our overall GDP, and by improving our relations with all of its members we can hope to see this trade increase further, securing even greater economic development for our nation."
 CSD_south_asian_trade: "South Asian Trade"
 CSD_south_asian_trade_desc: "Nations across South Asia have been successful in holding off the forces of communism, and to keep their economies afloat we must expand our exports to these nations. By reaching out to them and establishing fair trade deals, both Cascadia and the remaining non-communist South Asian states will prosper."

 JAS_securalization: "Government Secularisation"
 JAS_securalization_desc: "One of the main reasons we are in the mess we are today, is because of the radical policies of Islam forced onto the people by the Al-Islah government.

 JAS_alliance_soc: "Alliance with Socialist Parties"

 JAS_nationalization: "Limited Nationalisation Effort"

 JAS_federation: "The Federal System"
 JAS_federation_desc: "Following our removal of radicalism, it is time we begin the transition to a federal system.

In addition, local governments will be strengthened, allowing us to more easily solve local problems, increasing local support and faith in our democratic system."
 JAS_democracy: "A Shining Beacon of Democracy"
 JAS_democracy_desc: "All of our reforms have led to this moment, Yemen has changed, radically, and for the better.

 JAS_recovery: "National Recovery Plan"
 JAS_recovery_desc: "With elements of political reform implemented, it is time for us to also look towards the recovery of the economy. Hundreds of towns across the nation are devastated, key infrastructure is destroyed, and all major cities have been shelled to some degree. Implementing a ‘National Recovery Plan’ will allow for the rapid redevelopment and rebuilding of our nation."
 JAS_urban_rebuild: "Urban Rebuilding"

 JAS_rural_development: "Rural Development"

 JAS_power_project: "Yemeni Electrification Project"
 JAS_power_project_desc: "The Yemeni electrical net has historically been highly unreliable, with frequent power shortages plaguing the nation. The recent conflict has obviously not aided in these matters. Through the expansion and construction of new powerplants and the extension of electrical infrastructure throughout the nation, we will ensure an improved level of prosperity and normality to our citizens once again."
 JAS_industry_park: "New Industrial Parks"

 JAS_streamlined_production: "Streamline Production"
 JAS_streamlined_production_desc: "Streamlining of production has shown to be a very effective and efficient method of production. By copying this method, we can avoid having to make twelve different variants of the same car or weapon, increasing our output and competitiveness on the market."
 JAS_construction: "Modern Construction Methods"
 JAS_construction_desc: "Yemen is not a modern nation. Our war for freedom has revealed not only an archaic political system but also 20th-century construction methods. If Yemen is to prosper we should start implementing new architectural methods and import heavy construction material, bringing us into the 21st century."
 JAS_ports: "Upgraded Ports"
 JAS_ports_desc: "Our position along the Red Sea gives us access to one of the most used canals in the world, while the port of Aden has always been a historically important stop for shipping. We should expand our naval dockyards and modernise our harbours to allow nations across the globe to use our ports when making the crossing from the Suez. For a small fee of course."
 JAS_trade: "Establish Trade Links"
 JAS_trade_desc: "With the expansion of our harbours, the number of ships stopping at our ports has increased tenfold. Our next move should be to remind the world that Yemen has more to offer than a quick stop to refill their cargo ships. Here in Yemen, we have access to many natural resources and quality goods that the world would find useful!"
 JAS_tourism: "Promote Tourism"
 JAS_tourism_desc: "All of our economic and political reforms have made Yemen a desirable and stable location to visit. By promoting our historical monuments and unique architecture, our beautiful nature reserves and our idyllic beaches across the globe, our nation will bring in many new visitors, further diversifying our economy. Come visit Yemen!"
 JAS_cash_agriculture: "Cash-crop Agriculture"
 JAS_cash_agriculture_desc: "Apart from subsistence farming, many farmers rely on the cultivation of the drug khat to make a living. To improve our agricultural sector, we have two options. We can either continue to sell what we produce abroad, cultivating coffee and cotton as well, bringing in even an even larger influx of funds. Or we can focus on the cultivation of cereals, fruits and vegetables, increasing our nation’s self-sufficiency."
 JAS_mining: "Expanded Mining Operations"
 JAS_mining_desc: "Yemen has a veritable treasure trove in deposits of ores and precious minerals, unspoiled and untouched due to corruption and mismanagement. Cobalt, copper, nickel, gold… Even rare metals like niobium and tantalum are found below the ground. By investing in our mining sector, our economy will no doubt bloom as we will become a leading exporter of these riches of the earth!"
 JAS_oil: "Oil Drilling"
 JAS_oil_desc: "Much like our ore deposits, the provinces of Saba and Hadramout have large still untapped oil fields, ready to be exploited. While small in production compared to our Arab neighbours, we will position Yemen as one of the chief oil and natural gas exporting nations of the world!"
 JAS_diplomacy: "Yemen On the World Stage"
 JAS_diplomacy_desc: "Yemen is politically open to the world! We must now decide how to approach the powers of the world while remaining vigilant to protect our fledgeling democracy."
 JAS_canada: "The Canadian Link"
 JAS_canada_desc: "After much debate within the cabinet, we have come to our decision. Our like-minded Canadian friends across the Atlantic are the perfect choice for our expansion on the world stage. We will reach out to them and attempt to foster good relations between our two nations."
 JAS_canada_economy: "Economic Partnership"
 JAS_canada_economy_desc: "The economy of Yemen, whilst recovering, is not up to the same standards as the western world. Years of neglect by the Al-Islah government failed to modernise the economy. However, if we were to ask Canada for aid with this development we will be able to correct some of the mistakes made in the past."
 JAS_army_deals: "Military Deals"
 JAS_army_deals_desc: "Our military will never be able to develop if we continue to lag behind in modern equipment. We should ask Canada to help with our military equipment and military doctrines. With this aid, we should be able to develop our capabilities faster than if we were alone."
 JAS_canada_join: "Join the Democratic League"
 JAS_canada_join_desc: "As the new global defender of democratic freedoms and with our increasingly cordial relationship, the Republic of Yemen will ask for membership into the Democratic League. With this, the global democratic alliance gains a friend in the Middle East."
 JAS_arab_intervention: "Arab Interventionism"
 JAS_arab_intervention_desc: "Democracy in the Middle East is a dying idea. With Canadian advice, and our modernisation of the army, it is time we defend liberty for the Arab world. Some Arab nations are still bound by the shackles of an oppressive government. We will liberate our Middle Eastern brethren and deliver them the banner of democracy! Yumin Allah bialhuriya! Allah 'Akbar!"
 JAS_canada_advisors: "Canadian Advisors"
 JAS_canada_advisors_desc: "After the ratification of our alliance, Canada has been generous to us and has sent military advisors to teach and instruct our generals in the modern doctrines of warfare, which will be necessary to defeat our many enemies in battle."
 JAS_middle_east: "The Middle Eastern Connection"
 JAS_middle_east_desc: "As our immediate neighbours, we should not neglect our middle eastern brethren. They, much like Canada, can be a useful ally."
 JAS_cooperation_democracy: "Democratic Cooperation"
 JAS_cooperation_democracy_desc: "The democratic nations of the Middle East are few, but we should work with these states to form some level of cooperation. Whether through economic cooperation or military alliances, middle eastern democracies come work together, less they wish to be torn asunder by forces wishing to undermine the freedoms we worked so hard to protect."
 JAS_neutral_diplomacy: "Neutral Foreign Policy"
 JAS_neutral_diplomacy_desc:0 "Rather than be torn apart by global conflict, we will remain steadfast in the protection of our own citizens. In addition, isolation will allow us to prioritise other aspects of the economy rather than pushing a large percentage of our GDP into military expansion."
 JAS_defense: "National Defense Commitee"
 JAS_defense_desc: "While upholding our neutrality, we must be ready to defend it at all cost. The newly set up ‘National Defense Committee’ has started building forts along our borders and expanding the defensive capabilities of our ports, turning Yemen in a democratic fortress."
 JAS_prosperity: "Stable Prosperity"
 JAS_prosperity_desc: "Just as our top economic advisors predicted! By remaining neutral, we have been able to further invest in our civilian economy, becoming highly attractive to foreign investors for our peaceful stability. All while we continue to reap the benefits!"
 JAS_safe_heaven: "Intellectual Safe Heaven"
 JAS_safe_heaven_desc: "As global conflicts continue to rage on, neutrality has also attracted the global scientific community to our nation. With our promise of safety and allowing these researchers access to our top facilities, our scientific base has begun to further develop alongside our civilian economy. We will be a safe haven for anyone seeking peace and freedom!"
 JAS_speech: "The President's Speech"
 JAS_speech_desc: "The President has allocated a time and place to address the nation, with their recent success of reforming Yemen, there is no doubt that this speech will go down well with the population and create a sense of unity amongst the people."
 JAS_arab_alliance: "Alliance Of Arab States"
 JAS_arab_alliance_desc: "All across the Arab world, there are people living under oppression. There is only one country that we can turn to, to restore order to the Middle East. Ourselves. Today we will form our faction, the Alliance of Arab states, to bring together all like-minded Arab nations and reform the Middle East into a democratic bloc."
 JAS_invitation: "Invite Our Neighbours"
 JAS_invitation_desc: "All nations of the Arab world that believe in the holy principles of freedom and democracy! Join our cause! For every Arab should live and toil not under the jackboot of oppression, but under the sweet flower of liberty and democracy!"
 JAS_allies: "Look For Allies"
 JAS_allies_desc: "Whilst we could take the initiative ourselves and form a faction dedicated to the democratisation of the Arab world, it would be better to join forces with an existing faction in order to promote cooperation rather than further rivalries."
 JAS_resource_deals: "Resource Partnership Deals"
 JAS_resource_deals_desc: "Trade, trade, trade! Our allies are willing to exchange valuable resources and goods between us, and of course, we will accept these deals as not only does it benefit us, but all those within our faction."
 JAS_army_intergration: "Intergrate Our Militaries"
 JAS_army_intergration_desc: "By integrating our militaries, our alliance will be strengthened. While it will be difficult, not only will our soldiers be united under a single command structure, but it will also create a sense of unity amongst our governments, strengthening our resolve even further."
 JAS_arsenal_of_democracy: "Arsenal Of Democracy"
 JAS_arsenal_of_democracy_desc: "Roosevelt once said that America was the “Arsenal of Democracy”. With America gone, it is time another nation took up that mantle. Yemen will be the arsenal of democracy, and we will not fail to uphold it unlike the Americans did"
 JAS_arab_economic_unity: "Arab Economic Unity"
 JAS_arab_economic_unity_desc: "By establishing the Arab Economic Council we, and our allies, can tightly integrate our economies. This will increase production from our factories and will attract foreign investors in Arab markets."
 JAS_arab_liberation: "Liberate Those Yearning to Break Free"
 JAS_arab_liberation_desc: "Our combined militaries are ready to strike against all those standing against democracy. Freedom is the right of every human and freedom is what we shall bring. To all our Arab brothers, liberate those yearning to break free! Yumin Allah bialhuriya! Allah 'Akbar!"
 JAS_global_democracy: "Global Democracy"
 JAS_global_democracy_desc: "The best way to promote and strengthen global democracy is by establishing diplomatic missions and negotiating trade agreements, integrating each other’s economies. No doubt this will kickstart further economic growth for our nation!"
 JAS_british_guns: "British Guns"
 JAS_british_guns_desc: "Britain has withstood the rise of Communism in Europe and has maintained its democratic traditions. In addition, they are world-renowned for the quality of their guns in terms of accuracy and reliability. We should reach out to them and ask if they would be willing to sell us arms to further the cause of democracy. Our many precious resources will surely attract their attention?"
 JAS_aden_delhi: "Aden-Delhi Deal"
 JAS_aden_delhi_desc: "India lies just across the Indian Ocean, and is on the cusp of becoming a democratic and economic superpower. Surely we can cooperate together on trade? We should reach out to them and see about forming a workers programme that will grant employment to thousands of Indians in our growing industries."
 JAS_aus_mines: "Australian Mines"
 JAS_aus_mines_desc: "The Australians are another grand democracy situated in Oceania. Famous for their rich natural resources, they are mining giants in the global economy. Reaching out to them and cooperating on the extraction of these resources, will aid each other in our search for precious resources and will allow the Australians access to the finest Yemeni mines."
 JAS_tehran: "Tehran Connection"
 JAS_tehran_desc: "Iran, the closest democratic nation to us, has much to offer us. An economic and military giant, we will reach out to them and see if we can come to an agreement regarding the expansion and improvement of our military. Surely we can find common ground?"
 JAS_tokyo_summit: "Tokyo Summit"
 JAS_tokyo_summit_desc: "The Japanese host the most advanced electronics companies in the world. However, they are also heavily isolationist. Reaching out to them will be difficult, but should we succeed, we will give Japan an export market for their goods and they will give us access to the greatest electronics the world has to offer."
 PDY_liberation_war: "The Peoples Liberation War"
 PDY_liberation_war_desc: "The time has come! With the collapse of the Capitalist government, our return is at hand. The Yemeni people have been crying out for emancipation for years, and we shall deliver them! Socialism is at hand!"
 PDY_rally_forces: "Rally Our Forces"
 PDY_rally_forces_desc: "Decades of guerilla war have hardened our armies, but disparate cells of soldiers are not the tool for the war that we're fighting now. A grand mobilisation is needed. The workers of Yemen must be rallied and take up arms, for they are the vanguard of their own emancipation!"
 PDY_guns: "Guns For the People"
 PDY_guns_desc: "Our people's army must be armed! The workers cannot win their freedom with just industrial tools, arms are needed for our glorious struggle! Our comradely suppliers in the Warsaw Pact have those arms, we just need to convince them to pass some along to us."
 PDY_seize_industry: "Seize Government Industry"
 PDY_seize_industry_desc: "It is well known that war is a machine that consumes all that's input, but inputs are necessary for the ultimate victory. We must seize the means of production to ensure that we may never run short of the resources required for victory."
 PDY_foreign_brigades: "The Foreign Brigades"
 PDY_foreign_brigades_desc: "Our call for Revolution resounds all over Arabia! Already brave comrades have answered the red storm bell, and are rushing to our shores to fight for our righteous cause, risking life and limb out of comradely solidarity for us. All who want to fight for freedom should be welcomed, let none be turned away!"
 PDY_liberty_push: "The Push For Liberty"
 PDY_liberty_push_desc: "The final victory is within our grasp. The Yemeni proletariat is giving it all, all its blood, sweat and tears, so that they may never again be tramped down by the capitalists, imperialists and reactionaries. One final effort is all that's left; emancipation beckons!"
 PDY_south: "The Southern Movement"
 PDY_south_desc: "Within our movement is a chorus of voices calling for an independent South Yemen, free of the bureaucrats in Sana'a and their Islamist lackeys. Any attempt at building Socialism in all of Yemen will have to overcome those, it will be easier to consolidate in the South and establish a people's state here. The North will follow our shining example soon enough"
 PDY_united: "A United Yemen"
 PDY_united_desc: "We set out to liberate all of Yemen, and we cannot waver. Liberating only the south is akin to throwing the North to the wolves, a betrayal of all of our values. The banner of the people will wave from Hadhramaut to Asir, none shall be left behind! Yemen will be red, and it will be whole."
 PDY_restoration: "Re-establish the PDRY"
 PDY_restoration_desc: "The culmination of our struggle has been reached. Yemeni Socialism has risen anew! The sacrifices of so many people has not been in vain, for we have triumphed against all that have stood against us! Let us now strike while the iron is hot and forge from this victory a better future, a future for all the people!"
 PDY_armed_forces: "The Peoples Armed Forces"
 PDY_armed_forces_desc: "The brave militias that fought to liberate our lands have carried us to victory, but are too disorganized to protect our Revolution against outside threats. They must be reorganized into a fully fledged army, our Red Army. These armed forces will not fight for despots and imams, but for the people!"
 PDY_constitution_restoration: "Reinstate the Constitution"
 PDY_constitution_restoration_desc: "Military rule cannot last forever, for every decree passed by the sword can be rescinded by the sword. Instead, Socialism must be firmly rooted in the national legal code. The old Socialist constitution will be restored as the highest law of the land, a foundation of stone to build a new society upon."
 PDY_tribes: "The Tribes"
 PDY_tribes_desc: "Primitive remnants of Feudal Arabia, the tribes have attempted to reassert themselves during the civil war. This opposition to our modernizing force cannot be tolerated, and the tribes will be put back in their place. Yemen will become a modern country, dragged kicking and screaming if it has to."
 PDY_jasmins: "The Jasmines"
 PDY_jasmins_desc: "The Jasmine Council are naïve, believing in an oxymoronic democracy without Socialism. While ideological allies can be found among their ranks, their organisation is innately suspect and a potential vehicle for counter-revolution to spread to our country. The central committee will convene to decide their fate."
 PDY_trials: "The Trials"
 PDY_trials_desc: "The loathed reactionaries that originally abolished Socialism have been put in their place. But their betrayal shall not be forgotten, for it was they whose antisocial behaviour have caused two disastrous civil wars. For crimes such as these, no clemency shall be given, and the full extent of the law will be put to use in the name of justice."
 PDY_reorganization: "End Of the Reorganization"
 PDY_reorganization_desc: "The Party stands supreme! All of its enemies have been driven from our lands, sent running off to their masters of capital abroad, never to return. This is an apt time to relax martial law, end the curfew and allow the Yemeni proletariat to savour the liberties they bled so terribly for."
 PDY_congress: "Call A General Party Congress"
 PDY_congress_desc: "With the advent of peace comes the time to settle the most pressing issues of our time. Comrade Abu Baker al-Attas has a long list of moderate proposals he considers necessary for our Revolution to persevere, but many in the party feel like we should make the most of our victory and press ahead towards Full Communism."
 PDY_moderates: "The Moderates"
 PDY_moderates_desc: "The Party has urged caution, and the Moderates have won! Accelerating towards Communism would be premature, Yemen first needs to be prepared for a socialist transition before we can take the next step. We mustn’t forget that Socialism doesn’t exist for dogmatists to clap themselves on the shoulder, but for the sake of the people, to whom we are eternally dedicated."
 PDY_loyalists: "The Loyalists"
 PDY_loyalists_desc: "The Loyalist faction has come out on top! The workers of Yemen have decided that they will not waver or compromise on our inevitable march towards Communism. The leaders of the people that led us so boldly through the war will now likewise lead us through the peace, until every vestige of Capitalism and oppression have been scoured from Yemen."
 PDY_marxism_leninism: "Embrace Marxism Leninism"
 PDY_marxism_leninism_desc: "No other ideology has the scientific backing that Marxism-Leninism does! History has shown that if we want our society to prosper, there is no other way, no alternative. Central planning and the vanguard party are the most effective ways of organising society, and so they must naturally be utilized in Yemen too."
 PDY_full_nationalization: "Full Nationalization"
 PDY_full_nationalization_desc: "Our economy cannot be entrusted to the chaotic whims of private investors or the petty bourgeoisie. Only by bringing the entire economic apparatus under control of the People's State can Yemen be rebuilt and prosperity be returned to our lands. A planned economy results in planned prosperity."
 PDY_tribes_root: "Root Out Tribal Power"
 PDY_tribes_root_desc: "While the Party reigns supreme in the cities, many rural areas still see another loyalty directed to another pole: The Tribes. These vestiges of Feudal society are not just a challenge to the necessary paramount role of the party, but also roots for the deeply ingrained reactionary norms of our country. These roots must be ripped up, violently if they have to, for Socialism to succeed in Yemen."
 PDY_control: "Mantain Party Control"
 PDY_control_desc: "The reactionaries have been sent packing. The capitalists have been expropriated. The tribes have been subdued. All that oppose us have been defeated, driven off by the combined might of the people united. It must however not become an excuse to lower our guard, for if we do so, all we have attained might be squandered."
 PDY_freedoms: "Enshrine the People's Freedoms"
 PDY_freedoms_desc: "Can we really call ourselves socialists if we simply replace one tyrant with another draped in red? Supreme executive power derives its mandate from the masses, not from some farcical ideological ceremony! We must buy our legitimacy from the selfsame people we represent, by safeguarding their freedoms from tyrants abroad and overeager comrades at home."
 PDY_joint_economic_ventures: "Joint Private Economic Ventures"
 PDY_joint_economic_ventures_desc: "Socialism will not be built in a day. Yemen is still an impoverished country, with many living exactly as generations before them have lived. To modernize our country, we need capital, and few people have more of that than the Capitalists. We must swallow the bitter pill, and invite them in to aid in the modernization of our country."
 PDY_dialogue: "National Dialogue"
 PDY_dialogue_desc: "As we build Socialism in Yemen, we must strive to include all strata of society in our work. Dialogues must be held with all, from the most cosmopolitan urbanites to the most isolated tribal societies, to ensure that our socialism can truly unite all the many peoples of our country and be the result of the collective efforts of the creative masses, instead of a vision forced upon them by a clique of ideologues."
 PDY_elections: "Local Elections"
 PDY_elections_desc: "While our institutions may not yet be firmly rooted enough to allow elections on a national level, we can prove our commitment to popular governance by holding local elections. After all, the people deserve a say in how their local governorates and cities are administered. With all polls indicating massive support to the Party, what could possibly go wrong..."
 PDY_suffrage: "Reaffirm Universal Suffrage"
 PDY_suffrage_desc: "Women's rights in Yemen are in a deplorable state. All the advances we've accomplished have been undone by the counter-revolutionary regime we toppled. In order to get things back on track, we need to retread all of the lost ground. Our commitment to universal suffrage must be reaffirmed, that is the first step on the road towards a Yemen of equality."
 PDY_welfare_benefits: "Welfare Benefits"
 PDY_welfare_benefits_desc: "All beneath the heavens have been created by toiling hands. It is thanks to the tireless labour of the proletariat that we have foods, houses, power and everything else. This labour ought to be rewarded. Our workers, no matter of they're retired or between jobs, deserve access to healthcare, housing and food, just as anybody else does. A welfare state must be instated to ensure that."
 PDY_literacy_program: "Yemen Literacy Programs"
 PDY_literacy_program_desc: "Half of all Yemenis are incapable of reading and writing. This is unacceptable! An illiterate populace is one easily ensnared by reactionary values, incapable of emancipating themselves and their fellow comrades. A crash literacy program is imperative, teachers must be dispatched to every corner of the country and bring literacy to each and every comrade of ours."
 PDY_rights: "Unionised Labour Rights"
 PDY_rights_desc: "We may claim to represent the proletariat, but the revolutionary leadership always runs the risk of losing touch with the workers they represent Only with representation through the Unions, vehicles for proletarian will made manifest, can the connection between the Party and the workers be maintained."
 PDY_university: "Aden University"
 PDY_university_desc: "Sending our brightest young minds off to the rest of the world for a quality education might have been necessary so far, but the time has come for Yemen to join the international society of sciences. A world-class university will be constructed in Aden, hopefully capable of competing with Moscow and Oxford in educating the geniuses of tomorrow."
 PDY_healthcare: "Universal Healthcare"
 PDY_healthcare_desc: "The bourgeois rulers of Yemen neglected the people's healthcare, and what a calamity it has been. Medieval diseases, eradicated in Germany, Cuba and Russia, still thrive in Yemen, killing scores of innocents every day. This societal disease must be cured, with a rapid expansion of our national healthcare and the opening of our hospitals to all the people!"
 PDY_secularism: "A Secular Society"
 PDY_secularism_desc: "While the vast majority of our people are faithful Muslims, there are those among us who do not hold that faith. These people deserve to live in peace and prosperity as equals alongside their Muslim comrades! Henceforth all faiths and creeds in Yemen shall be made equal, provided that they do not advocate for the return of Capitalism!"
 PDY_support: "Widespread Base of Support"
 PDY_support_desc: "Not a person in Yemen can be found for whom our rule has not brought benefit. The people know that we are doing our utmost to improve their lot, to bring them schools, hospitals and roads, and they love us for it. We should transform this support for our accomplishments into a support for the State, to permanently affix Socialism in not just the minds, but in the hearts of Yemen as well!"
 PDY_recruits: "Recruitment Campaigns"
 PDY_recruits_desc: "Our brave armed forces overcame the forces of reaction, and gave Socialism in Yemen a new lease on life! However, this victory has attracted the attention of bigger fish, some that would rather see the red flag lowered in tatters than let us fly it. We must increase the size of our armed forces to protect the Revolution from those who would do it harm!"
 PDY_morale: "High Morale"
 PDY_morale_desc: "Our soldiers must know that they are the torchbearers of a proud legacy! Bold comrades before us have fought for emancipation against the British, against the Feudalists and even against the Americans, and in each case did they triumph. Now, our soldiers are fighting just as heroically to preserve what those before have accomplished, so that the Red Banner may wave yet over Yemen for centuries to come!"
 PDY_united_republic: "The Republic Forever United"
 PDY_united_republic_desc: "Nobody had believed that we would rise from the ashes when our People’s Republic was tramped down, but we kept the flame of revolution alight, and see how our efforts have been rewarded! We have built a Socialist state that shall last through the ages, one that will forever be a shining example for the Arab world that it is possible to move beyond Feudalism and Capitalism! The Revolution prevails!"
 PDY_plan: "The Four Year Plan"
 PDY_plan_desc: "Our country must be transformed! Our country is half a century behind the rest of the Socialist World. This is unacceptable! Where simple adobe huts and sand dunes lie will soon be a modern country, with modern highrises and industries, all working to benefit our people. No longer shall they be abandoned in squalor, for their emancipation from want has come!"
 PDY_development: "National Redevelopment"
 PDY_development_desc: "The key ingredient to modernization is industrial equipment. Without this, our industrialization programmes are fated to either a snail’s pace or to not happen at all! All our efforts must be put towards developing the factors of production, so that we may step boldly into the age of modernity and join our comrades."
 PDY_water: "Yemen Water And Irrigation Works"
 PDY_water_desc: "Agriculture is the cornerstone of Yemen, and yet the Feudalists have relegated our comrade-farmers to toil with little to no investments in essential infrastructure. When we’re done, Yemen will blossom like an oasis, as irrigation canals water our country from end to another, finally allowing Yemeni agriculture to reach its full potential!"
 PDY_farming: "Cooperative Farming"
 PDY_farming_desc: "As with everything else it has touched, Capitalism has reduced farming, the foundation for human civilisation, to a game of profits and competition. In this game, the winners are the Capitalists, while the losers are the people. Let us change the rules, so that the winners may now be those who cooperate, and bring tidings of bountiful harvests to all."
 PDY_electricity: "Upgrade the Electrical Net"
 PDY_electricity_desc: "Our power grid, already underdeveloped before the war thanks to Feudalist mismanagement, was damaged during our glorious revolutionary war! But as Lenin said, Communism cannot be brought about without Electrification! The power grid will be modernized, power plants will be upgraded and supplemented with solar energy so that the people of Yemen can at long last thrive under the red banner."
 PDY_manufacturing: "Manufacturing Economy"
 PDY_manufacturing_desc: "With a modern power grid follows a modern economy. Being dependent on imports from our Socialist comrades around the world might be good for relationships, but Yemen should stand on her own legs! Our people must see the fruits of their own labours, not those of their comrades across the world. The seeds have been sown, and soon a manufacturing economy will bloom in our land!"
 PDY_coast: "Coastal Highway Project"
 PDY_coast_desc: "Socialism is a project about bringing the working peoples, the creative masses together. Bringing people together requires infrastructure however, and the previous government has unfortunately been slacking in that regard. We shall take up where they failed, and pave grand highways connecting our workers from east to west!"
 PDY_defenses: "Arming the People's Defenses"
 PDY_defenses_desc: "Our revolutionary efforts will all have been for nought if the Imperialists can just bomb Yemen back into the stone age. Our fortifications must be in top shape, and rifles must abound, for the Revolution to be preserved!"
 PDY_workers: "Tools Of the Workers"
 PDY_workers_desc: "Modernizing our country can’t just happen in the commanding heights of the economy, the signs of the advancement of our country need to be apparent to all, from high to low. The people won’t know that it is ongoing if they are working with the same tools as their grandparents. Our factories must be equipped with the newest of the new and not one farm may be without a tractor when we are done!"
 PDY_hub: "The Aden Hub"
 PDY_hub_desc: "Aden is the homeplace of our largest harbour, the nexus for all trade going in and out of Yemen. With our growing economy however, the harbour can no longer keep up with our demand for docking capacity. More piers must be constructed, and more workers attracted, so that Aden can truly become the shining jewel of the Indian ocean it deserves to be."
 PDY_tourism: "Socotran Tourism"
 PDY_tourism_desc: "Socotra is an island like no other! Thanks to its geographic isolation, it is homeplace to a plethora of plants and animals not found anywhere else in the world. Naturally this is worth preserving, but preservation unfortunately does not come for free. Thus, we should also open it up to the workers of the world to visit, allowing for tourists to come and see what Yemen has to offer."
 PDY_resources: "The Peoples Resources"
 PDY_resources_desc: "All beneath the heavens belongs to the working class! No longer is access to natural resources limited to those who own and kept from those who don’t. All that can be found in Yemen is now shared equally among all of her peoples: every drop of water, every hectare of land, every lump of metal. With this, we have at long last proved to the people that our promises were not for nought."
 PDY_sufficiency: "Increase Self-Sufficiency"
 PDY_sufficiency_desc: "Yemen is but a singular red state in a region of reaction. Unless a red tidal wave washes over Arabia and unites us all under the banner of equality, we are dependent on foreign imports. This dependence must be lowered, so that we may not be cut off from the most basic of supplies and necessities. Only when we have attained self-sufficiency can we rest assured that Socialism is triumphant in Yemen."
 PDY_internationalism: "Yemeni Internationalism"
 PDY_internationalism_desc: "The revolution stands triumphant at home, but we cannot linger! If we are content to just shut ourselves off from all our comrades abroad who suffer under the yoke of theocrats and despots, we are no better than those theocrats and despots ourselves. We must announce to the whole world that the PDRY stands with all oppressed and downtrodden, no matter which boot they may find themselves under!"
 PDY_socialism: "Nurture Arab Socialism"
 PDY_socialism_desc: "Yemen does not have the resources to throw itself into endeavours halfway across the globe, but as the red book says, from each according to his ability. Yemen can still contribute to the growth of Socialism here in the Arab world. We shall strengthen ties with our local comrades, so that we may stand strong and stand together against those that would undo our popular revolutions."
 PDY_pop_coucil: "The South Arabian Popular Council"
 PDY_pop_coucil_desc: "Coordination cannot just happen on an ad-hoc basis. We must stand together with our comrades on a more permanent basis. Just like our comrades in Europe have the European Union must we have our own thing as well. The South Arabian Socialist Council shall be formed, so that we too shape our future in Union!"
 PDY_observers: "Invite Observer Nations"
 PDY_observers_desc: "Though our council may have ‘Arabian’ in its name, we should not limit access for those comrades that want to join, be they Arabian or not. Let us open the doors for all who will merrily aid in the establishment of Socialism around the globe. Let comrades from near or far join us as observers!"
 PDY_common_army: "Military Cooperation"
 PDY_common_army_desc: "Our cooperation can yet be deepened. With our mutual dependence and assistance, calamity would not be limited if one of us were to fall to a counter-revolution. We must stand together, for we either fight united or die divided!"
 PDY_market: "A Common Market"
 PDY_market_desc: "As we share our Socialist principles, let us not forget that ideals are just ideals. What really matters is the material, the prosperity that Socialism produces for all. A removal of tariffs between our comradely partners and us will ensure that we can all share equally in our prosperity."
 PDY_alliance: "South Arabian Alliance"
 PDY_alliance_desc: "For each step taken, the next one only feels more natural. The Council now is not just a group of likeminded comrades, but an institution, one that forever aids the establishment of Socialism in our little corner of the world. Such institutions must be protected, with an alliance of mutual partners, standing together under the red banner."
 PDY_unity_dream: "The Dream of Unity"
 PDY_unity_dream_desc: "Many Arabian states can really only trace their raison d’etre back to the territories of feudal monarchs, with borders drawn where their fiefdoms started and ended. But Socialism transcends such borders, and there is no reason to let us divide ourselves along such archaic constructs. The council will be taken further, so that all comrades within Arabia may, someday, be united!"
 PDY_religion: "The Question Of Religion"
 PDY_religion_desc: "With the ubiquity of Islam in Arabia, there are many voices calling for the imposition of State Atheism in our upcoming union state. However, there are just as many who are opposed to such ideas and would rather not trample over one of the most firmly rooted social institutions of our land. As we are moving towards a union, we must decide how to deal with this issue."
 PDY_federal: "The Question Of Federalization"
 PDY_federal_desc: "Our territory will not necessarily be entirely geographically contiguous. As such, a unitary state will have more difficulty functioning than one might initially suspect. Nevertheless, a federal state would likewise hold drawbacks, as maintaining democratic centralism would be easier without federal states. This question ought to be settled sooner rather than later."
 PDY_parties: "Question of the Parties"
 PDY_parties_desc: "Naturally, there is no avoiding that we are not a single party. Instead, we are all comrades, each with our own parties and structures. Fusing the parties sounds like the natural choice, but that runs the risk of one section just dominating the others. Instead, we could opt to just unite our parties in a coalition, allowing for regional representation in our Union through the currently existing parties."
 PDY_treaties: "Prepare The Treaties"
 PDY_treaties_desc: "The pieces are in place. The people are prepared. The leaders are willing. All that’s needed to be done now is to narrow down the precise details for unification. The unification of our bureaucracies, of our economies, of our political systems, of our peoples. In just the stroke of a pen, the archaic Arabian systems shall be swept away beneath the tidal wave of popular will!"
 PDY_south_arabia: "The Union Of South Arabia"
 PDY_south_arabia_desc: "No more shall ancient kingdoms and fiefs determine the fate of the Arabian people! By the power of popular will, we have reshaped the peninsula in a fairer and more equal direction, so that all its peoples can together ceaselessly create a fairer and more just future, one undoubtedly shaped by the will of the people! Workers, break the bonds of nations, for humanity beckons!"
 PDY_workers_unite: "Workers of the Arab World Unite!"
 PDY_workers_unite_desc: "Despite all we have accomplished, our revolution does not yet know peace. Powers hostile to the popular will yet dominate the Arab world, ready to trample down upon any signs of the revolution. If we are to persevere, we must act before they do! The Revolution will come to their shores and their peoples shall be liberated, until the entirety of Arabia is united under the scarlet banner!"
 PDY_friends: "Friends of the Revolution"
 PDY_friends_desc: "Yemen’s friends cannot just be found in the Communist parties of Arabia, shining red beacons are glowing on every continent, illuminating the world with knowledge that a better future is possible. Bridges must be built to even the farthest comrades, to show them our achievements and to learn of theirs."
 PDY_china: "The Chinese Dragon"
 PDY_china_desc: "Chairman Mao set an example much like ours, winning a bold revolutionary war despite years in the wilderness. As such, the People’s Republic of China and the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen are fraternal socialist nations like no other. We may not agree entirely on all policies, but strengthened ties may only bring mutual benefit!"
 PDY_india: "The Indian Tiger"
 PDY_india_desc: "Even though India has not had the long history of being a Socialist Republic, it has still been a firm and faithful ally of the Socialist powers for many decades, and for every day, the Indian proletariat is striving ever closer to joining their comrades around the world in fraternal socialist union. We should aid them on the way, and maybe learn a thing or two from their electronics sector in the process."
 PDY_germany: "The Yemen-Germany Treaty"
 PDY_germany_desc: "Long has it been apparent to all that Germany was the real leader of the Socialist world, and we cannot forget our ties through history to the German Democratic government either. These ties must be reaffirmed, and Yemen must strive to become closer with the Warsaw Pact, so that the powers of the world may not forget us either."
 PDY_eu: "EU Investements"
 PDY_eu_desc: "No other entity on Earth is as prosperous as the European Union, and nowhere else are the plentitudes of Socialism more apparent. The EU has just what Yemen needs to industrialize, heavy industrial equipment and modern technology. We should encourage them to send some comradely aid our way, so that we may be their faithful friend in the Indian Ocean."
 PDY_equipment: "Buy Surplus Equipment"
 PDY_equipment_desc: "Europe is home to an armaments industry centuries old, refined and perfected through multiple economic systems. It’s no secret that our armed forces need new equipment, so maybe the Europeans are willing to sell us some of theirs, so that we can protect the revolution here as well as they do there."
 PDY_intel: "Intelligence Sharing"
 PDY_intel_desc: "The German Ministry for State Security has historically been a great friend of ours, helping us set up our own organs for protecting the revolution covertly. Many of our agents fondly remember their training in Germany, and still hold ties to the country. We should draw upon those ties and establish a series of intelligence sharing programs, for mutual revolutionary benefit."
 PDY_warsaw_pact: "Apply For Warsaw Pact Membership"
 PDY_warsaw_pact_desc: "Storm clouds are gathering around the world, as the hatchet of war thought buried seven decades ago is once more being unearthed. The Capitalists have smelled blood, and are gearing up to crush the world revolution. We have tasted the perils of Capitalism, and agree that it may not threaten the world once more. We must join with the Warsaw Pact and stand against the foes of liberty."
 PDY_route: "The Oriental Route"
 PDY_route_desc: "While our most developed friends can be found in the west, it would be neglect if we ignored the east. Great socialist heroes have risen and won in the east, ones that we can learn greatly from. Let us reach out to our comrades in Asia and learn from their bold examples."
 PDY_training: "Military Training"
 PDY_training_desc: "Now that we have joined the Pact, our armies must be brought up to snuff. We cannot let our allies down with sloppy training and inferior strategies, the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen must be on par with our allies as we fight for peace and liberty for all of mankind!"
 PDY_navy: "Naval Readiness"
 PDY_navy_desc: "Not just the army must be prepared for when the War comes, our navy must stand ready as well. The Indian Ocean is big, giving the Capitalists and Reactionaries a backdoor into our nation, one they can and will ruthlessly exploit if we are not prepared. Our sailors are bold and brave, let them sail out and prepare for the war that is to come."
 PDY_liberation: "Liberate Our Arab Brothers"
 PDY_liberation_desc: "The Arab world is a den of reaction, and moreover, a den of reaction sitting upon some of the greatest oil reserves on the planet. Every drop of oil can become a drop of fuel in the tanks and planes of the enemies of the revolution, but we will not let that happen. The Arab world will preemptively be liberated, the red banner will not see opposition!"
 PDY_soviets: "Rekindle The Soviet Alliance"
 PDY_soviets_desc: "The Soviet Union is still the premier socialist power of the world, those that lit the beacon for others to follow. While it has been a few rough years for them, they are not alone. The people of Yemen stand with them, let us send the Soviets a declaration of our solidarity and remind them that the free peoples of the world shall not abandon them!"
 PDY_soviet_aid: "Soviet Economic Assistance"
 PDY_soviet_aid_desc: "Our declaration of solidarity did not fall on deaf ears. The Soviet Union has heard us and embraced us as comrades. What’s more, our strengthened relationship has opened the Soviets’ eyes to the plight of the Yemeni people, and their bountiful industry is already flowing into our ports to help us along the same path they followed. Spasibo!"
 PDY_caribbean: "Friends In the Caribbean"
 PDY_caribbean_desc: "It is said that Cuba’s chief export is doctors, and while that may not be the whole truth, they are definitely one of the premier exports. Let us borrow some, and make use of their world-class medical schools to train a new generation of Yemeni doctors, so that the impressive achievements made under Comrade Castro can be made once more here."
 PDY_south_america: "Mines of the Andes"
 PDY_south_america_desc: "Far away, across the ocean, lies a land rich in both minerals and comrades. While not everyone in South America proudly proclaims allegiance to the immortal science of Marxism-Leninism, we can still form ties with them. The Andes mountains in particular are host to a wealth of natural resources that Yemeni industry would be all too eager to have access too."
 PDY_central_america: "Fruits Of Centro-America"
 PDY_central_america_desc: "Thanks to our efforts, Yemen now has a blossoming agricultural sector, but there still are a few things that can’t be found on our store shelves. Tropical fruits meanwhile abound in plenty in Centroamerica, Ortega’s little workers’ paradise in that region. We should establish trade relations."
 PDY_uapr: "A Visit to LA"
 PDY_uapr_desc: "America, once the foe of all working peoples, has too seen the light. The Union of American Peoples’ Republics shows that even the most ardent of reactionaries can come around to Socialism eventually. As our country likewise has a long history of reaction, we should visit them and see what can be learned from the American example."
 PDY_preserve_revolution: "Preserving The Revolution"
 PDY_preserve_revolution_desc: "Reaction is no more. The alleged ‘moderates’ in the Party have shown their true colours, but we have dealt with their insolence. Now, there simply is the matter of their running dogs, crowding the streets and calling for the restoration of the former government. No matter, the rabble will be easily scattered. The counter-revolution will be crushed."
 PDY_agents: "Agents In the Rebellion"
 PDY_agents_desc: "Naivete clearly abounds amongst the rabble, their leaders too blindly trusting of their compatriots, ill aware that we had already planted our men among their ranks even before these protests began. This naivete will become their undoing. They will not see it coming when their ‘friends’ stab them in the back, swiftly cutting the head off the snake."
 PDY_tanks: "Tanks In the Streets"
 PDY_tanks_desc: "A show of force is necessary to deter those most liable to wavering, to deter those that are simply in the streets because they have been lured by demagogues and populists. Our allies in the Armed Forces hold the key to that show of force. Tanks will fill the streets, and hopefully the mere sight of these armoured monstrosities is enough to scare away all but the most deluded."
 PDY_purges: "Purges In the Party"
 PDY_purges_desc: "Naturally there are those in the party that, despite their professions of loyalty, are more loyal to the idol of Mammon than the cause of the people. Finding them, however, will be trivial. The weakest will break and reveal to us the rest of those complicit in undermining the socialist revolution. Then, the party will be exorcised of their corruptive influence."
 PDY_sword: "Welding Party And Secret Police"
 PDY_sword_desc: "With order restored to our streets, the time has come to take the necessary precautions to securing Socialism in Yemen forthwith. The Party has shown itself to be unreliable, but discarding it completely is a fool’s errand. They can still be useful to us. We must ensure that our men are placed at every level of the party hierarchy, to keep them in line, and form a council to lead the country where they failed."
 PDY_trained: "Trained By the Best"
 PDY_trained_desc: "Not all that we have have we gotten by our own hands. Our comrades in the German Stasi have been a great aid in our training. The time has come to prove to our mentors that their time has not been wasted. We will be the sword and shield of the Yemeni revolution, ever protecting it from those that would unravel it."
 PDY_no_revolts: "No More Revolts"
 PDY_no_revolts_desc: "It would be a waste if we had to spend any more time crushing meek rebellions underfoot. Our solution is simple: The act of rebellion shall become a thing of the past, civil unrest made simply impossible. Only when we have expunged such ideas from our people’s consciousness have we succeeded, and we shall lay the first stones now."
 PDY_loyalty: "Ensure Our People’s Eternal Loyalty"
 PDY_loyalty_desc: "It would be suboptimal to sit in an ivory tower with a people disgruntled, at best, towards our rule. All opposing poles of power must be exterminated, to give our people no other alternative than to pledge their loyalty towards our state. The first steps will be taken now, and when we are done, Yemen shall be reshaped in our image."
 PDY_root_tribes: "Uproot the Tribes"
 PDY_root_tribes_desc: "Archaic institutions have no place in our country. The tribes are an authority unto themselves, social groups not yet under our control. Time may be our ally, but waiting for the tribes to wither away is a fool’s errand. Just once, using a harsh but firm hand to wipe the slate clean and to uproot the tribes, to erase them from our peoples’ memory, is a necessary action."
 PDY_front: "Commisars To the Frontlines"
 PDY_front_desc: "The ideological schooling in Yemen has unfortunately been rather lacking. The common foot soldier is unaware of the greater picture, merely fighting for some fledgling notion of ‘nationalism’ or ‘family’. While such errors will be corrected in time, certain measures must be taken until then. Each army company will be equipped with a Commissar, to ensure that the soldiery does not step out of line."
 PDY_identity: "Total Ideological Loyalty"
 PDY_identity_desc: "The upper echelons of the armed forces may have fought for decades, but we have uncovered certain deficiencies in their loyalty nevertheless. More than a few profess loyalty to this so-called ‘Southern Movement’, a shameful regionalist ideal. Rectification is needed. These officers will be reschooled, to ensure that they have nothing less than total loyalty to our Republic."
 PDY_state: "The Unitary State"
 PDY_state_desc: "Decentralising the apparatus of state is a fool’s errand, allowing infiltrators and underminers to snatch control of government branches one by one. Our vigilance will not be dropped, all organs of state will be centralized and brought under control of the National Security Council. Yemen will either be a unitary state, or there will not be a state at all."
 PDY_enlighten: "Enlighten the People"
 PDY_enlighten_desc: "He who controls the present, commands the future. He who commands the future, conquers the past. The people of Yemen yet live in the mindsets of the bygone feudal era. We shall wipe the slate clean. The education system will be unrecognizable when we are done, the schools teaching our curriculum, the people believing in our truths. They have chains upon their minds, but we shall set them free."
 PDY_direct_control: "Assuming Direct Control"
 PDY_direct_control_desc: "With our programme of reeducation coming to a close, army command is proving much more loyal. A few generals did raise a stink during the process however. While we have not found traces of insurrectionist thought, it is best to keep them close. Allowing the Chief of Army into the National Security Council gives them a sense of recompense, but also allows us to keep a much closer eye on the military."
 PDY_dagger: "Communism With A Cloak And Dagger"
 PDY_dagger_desc: "Overt saber rattling has been a common fallacy for less intelligent comrades of ours to engage in, but we shall not commit that same mistake. Our war against the repressors shall be one waged in the shadows. By tenderly pruning the rotten branches, we can with much greater ease preserve the tree. The people will live in blissful ignorance while we secure the future for them. "
 PDY_keep: "Keeping What Works"
 PDY_keep_desc: "Despite the reactionary tendencies of the former moderate government, a few kernels of Marxian truth could yet be found in their agenda. Just as we’ve preserved the party in a state more suitable for our purposes, let us preserve these remains and repurpose them in a more appropriate direction."
 PDY_support_base: "Bases Of Support In The Furthest Regions"
 PDY_support_base_desc: "It is folly to concentrate all of our supporters within the capital, such methods only invite the marginalized rebels in the countryside to it down. Instead, we should ensure that our supporters are spread around evenly, to ensure that a basic level can be found in even the furthest region of Yemen."
 PDY_vanguard: "Vanguard of the Women"
 PDY_vanguard_desc: "The repression of the woman is the result of a feeble mind, shackled by the delusions of yesterday. Needless to say, we shall not entertain such delusions. The biggest opponents to female integration will ‘disappear’, their places to be taken by people of a more agreeable disposition. Female liberation will come, whether Yemen would like it or not."
 PDY_automated: "The Automated Model"
 PDY_automated_desc: "The economy is the lifeblood of every nation, and just like with humans, subversive agents can infect the whole body, transmitted through the lifeblood. This will be brought under our supervision too. Automation has proven a boon for Chile and for Germany, allowing unfiltered central control of the entire economic apparatus. Learning from their example is essential."
 PDY_online: "Always-Online Nation"
 PDY_online_desc: "Yemen is still very much an analog country, with digital integration still being years behind the powers of the world. We cannot do with so little. Every city, every block, every appliance, must be remotely accessible and surveilable. Then, discovering the last disparate hiding places of the counterrevolution will be trivial."
 PDY_aden_cables: "All Cables Lead To Aden"
 PDY_aden_cables_desc: "With our mainframe in place in Aden, the city has become the nexus for our state. With the mainframe in place, all the nation shall be connected to here, ensuring total control of the entire state from one place. From here, even the furthest corners of the nation will be in reach, allowing our grip to be not just firm, but total."
 PDY_chip: "Microchipping A Nation"
 PDY_chip_desc: "The so-called ‘Intranet of Things’ is a truly marvelous invention, connecting everything imaginable. This is another splendid tool in our arsenal to ensure that opposition may never again rear its head towards our state. We should implement control chips in every piece of electronics in Yemen. Perhaps some day, we may even implant these into our loyal citizens..."
 PDY_false_prophet: "Operation False Prophet"
 PDY_false_prophet_desc: "Only more prevalent than our reach are the mosques of Yemen, the people flocking there for salvation from earthly sins. This opiate may be revolting, but it can also be twisted to suit our needs. The imams can be turned to our side, or replaced by supposed men of the cloth whose true loyalties do not lie with superstition, but with our cause."
 PDY_socialism_nurture: "Socialism As Spirituralism"
 PDY_socialism_nurture_desc: "It is folly to reject the certain spiritual drives of some people. Always is there a need for something greater to be attained. With our total control over Yemeni society, we can ensure that it is our will that will eventually become what the people strive for. The cults of the past will be replaced with the cult of the future: Our cult. "
 PDY_revolution_preserved: "The Revolution Preserved"
 PDY_revolution_preserved_desc: "Our initial measures have certainly been a qualified success. All opponents to our rule have been scattered, and the first pieces have been put in place to ensure that our rule will forever remain unchallenged. Some festivities might be in order, reinforcing our rule and reminding the people of our benevolence would certainly only be beneficial."
 PDY_shadows: "Our Place In the Shadows"
 PDY_shadows_desc: "The Arab World is a dangerous one, a place where every misstep could invite unwanted danger to our little revolution. This cannot come to pass. We must always fight where we are strongest, waging our war against the reactionaries in the shadows, rather than openly."
 PDY_warfare: "Intelligent Warfare"
 PDY_warfare_desc: "Yemen is a small country, with scarce military resources. These must be used effectively, striking at the enemy’s weak points wherever these may be found. Our army doctrine will be shaped as such, focusing on intelligence and reconnaissance rather than brute force. A correctly placed dagger can do infinitely more damage than a thousand poorly aimed guns."
 PDY_politics: "Politics Of Necessity"
 PDY_politics_desc: "The actions we have undertaken so far have uneased even people we considered stalwarts, revealing them to be little more than bleeding hearts. They must see that what we are doing is not out of some malignant desire to hurt, but simply out of political necessity. The results have been apparent. Yemen has been dragged into modernity. Anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool."
 PDY_infiltrate: "Infiltrate Their Governments"
 PDY_infiltrate_desc: "The mind of the feudalist is a simple one, attracted to the smallest of tangible rewards, without heed for anything even resembling principles or ideals. Where others would see moral failing however, do we see opportunity. Every corrupt official is a potential access point for our operatives to gain access to our enemies’ most classified information, and if it comes to it, we can silence them quickly."
 PDY_info: "Steady Stream Of Information"
 PDY_info_desc: "Our infiltration program has had bigger success than anticipated. Scores of officials are officially on our payroll now, providing our state with a steady stream of information. Naturally, this should only be encouraged. A few extra meagre scraps thrown their way will only improve our access, while less cooperative figures can be removed and replaced with more compliant ones."
 PDY_connections: "Corrupt Connections"
 PDY_connections_desc: "The Arabian peninsula is rich in oil, but very poor in civil spirit. For just a few riyal can we bribe oil company workers all around the peninsula to siphon some of their oil for us. The Feudalists will hardly notice anyways."
 PDY_abduct: "Abduct Their Brightest Minds"
 PDY_abduct_desc: "Our scientific base is woefully inadequate. The decades of civil strife have left their mark. A pity, but this issue is hardly unsolvable. The rest of the Arab world has a bounty of well-educated people, all wasting their talents for regressive feudal states. Since these states would almost certainly be indifferent about them, let us bring them here, and make them work for us instead."
 PDY_spies: "Crimson Shadow Over Arabia"
 PDY_spies_desc: "Our presence is everywhere, unseen but felt by all. Nowhere are the servants of reaction safe, always needing to look themselves over the shoulder twice. Our contacts can be found in every layer of society, working directly for our shadow state. A sense of paranoia has descended upon the region, distrust undermining every effort undertaken by our enemies. We have done well to foster this..."
 PDY_intel_state: "The Intelligence State Perfected"
 PDY_intel_state_desc: "Our measures have been effective. We now know of every move, every thought, undertaken by the counterrevolutionaries in the entire region, with tendrils reaching beyond our little corner of the world. Conversations held in utmost secrecy by foreign heads of state are known to us. We see all, we hear all. Nothing is beneath our gaze."
 PDY_german_guns: "Arms From Germany"
 PDY_german_guns_desc: "The Germans gave us the tools we needed before, they can be convinced to do so again. We cannot protect our revolution solely by knowing where our enemies are, we must also be able to cleanse them out from their hideouts and bases. We need guns, trucks, tanks and all that the Germans can provide for us."
 PDY_supply: "Our Own Suppliers"
 PDY_supply_desc: "The Germans may have trained us, but they are not to be relied upon. Self-sufficiency and autarky is our best bet in the long term, so that we may not be cut off. We can craft our own tools, in our own factories, and thus always be certain that we have what we need."
 PDY_nva: "Training With The NVA"
 PDY_nva_desc: "Our ties to Germany can only benefit from being strengthened. Observers from Stasi have been impressed with the measures we have taken, and have offered to train our Armed Forces. While we typically could not trust such outside influences, the Germans have always proven reliable and professional. Let us take them up on their offer, to sharpen our blade."
 PDY_sky: "Eternal Skyward Vigilance"
 PDY_sky_desc: "The enemy can not just be found on the ground. With the ubiquity of air travel, the risk of them coming from above is too high to be ignored. Vast radar stations must be constructed, to keep watch on our skies and ensure that our air space will remain unviolated for perpetuity."
 PDY_navy_secret: "The Unseen Navy"
 PDY_navy_secret_desc: "Grand naval manoeuvres with mighty destroyers are obvious to all, and such aggression cannot easily be hidden. Our navy must specialize in working unseen, in cutting the vital arteries of our enemies from below the depths. Submarines allow us to do exactly that, and shall henceforth become the emphasis of our naval endeavours."
 PDY_unison: "Sword And Dagger In Unison"
 PDY_unison_desc: "We are prepared. The Armed Forces have become a reliable tool of our government, trained and ready to execute its will when we give the word. Any disagreements there may have been have been corrected, any dissent has been erased. We can stand sure that wherever the dagger will point, the sword will follow. Yemen cannot be defeated."
 PDY_prune: "The Final Prune of the Party"
 PDY_prune_desc: "Despite our purge of the party, there has been some... questioning of the measures we have taken. The naysayers, well meaning as they may be, are not suitable for government. We cannot have indecisiveness ruling our land. Those who will not act with conviction must be cast aside, to make way for men with the right mindsets. The Party is a tool, and a tool must be made to serve the wielder."
 PDY_aden: "From Aden To the Nation!"
 PDY_aden_desc: "Information is the most valuable currency. Hitherto, people have depended on very local sources for theirs, but these sources are flawed. Hitherto, we have found 24.735 discrepancies between official policy and local publications. They must be replaced. All households will henceforth be issued one standard television set, so the people may receive the information we want them to and nothing more."
 PDY_network: "Expanding the Network"
 PDY_network_desc: "Our cybernetic computer network has been a worthwhile investment. Real-time data from all over the country is being processed daily. As the people are warming up to the network, it’s time to initiate Phase 2: Connected to our network shall a massive CCTV network without comparison be. The National Security Council is always watching, always listening."
 PDY_stone: "Not A Single Stone Unturned"
 PDY_stone_desc: "76% of the Yemeni people are registered within our database. We now know of their consumption habits, their lifestyle choices and their daily routines. All of this is being analyzed daily by machines, to ensure that habitual criminals and saboteurs can be caught before they act. The remaining 24% must follow, so that not one enemy of the revolution may hide in their numbers."
 PDY_primacy: "Permanent Political Primacy"
 PDY_primacy_desc: "The Party has been rendered a vestige, a crude weapon from a more primitive age. Our Vanguard has taken up its rightful place as the all-seeing guardians of the revolution. All that remains are mere formalities. The National Security Council will be enshrined as the guardians of our land. Let all other poles of power wither away, for this authority shall not be questioned."
 PDY_surveilence: "The Surveillance State Perfected"
 PDY_surveilence_desc: "The country is our oyster. Dissidence has become a phenomenon of the past. Critics of our government are silenced before they speak. Protesters are arrested before their slogans have been drafted. Rebels are shot before they take up arms. We have accomplished what lesser-willed leaders could only dream of. Long live the Revolution."
