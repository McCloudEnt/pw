YAR_Success_of_the_Play:0 "Success Of The Play!"
YAR_Success_of_the_Play_desc:0 "Today begins the long-awaited end of the Al-Islah government. With our coalition gathered and the nation fractured, only the strong will survive the onslaught of this war. With the Houthis and Nasserists rallied, and Saleh leading our forces, the die has been cast and the roll is in our favour."
YAR_Rally_Republican_Guard:0 "Rally The Republican Guard"
YAR_Rally_Republican_Guard_desc:0 "The Republican Guard forms the backbone of our army, and without them, it is likely the war would already be over. By rallying the Republican Guard and reminding them what they are fighting for, morale within our ranks will increase exponentially and Yemen will be ours for the taking."
YAR_Legit_Government:0 "Legitimise The Government"
YAR_Legit_Government_desc:0 "The Yemeni people have been failed again and again by Al-Islah, and it is high time that they are granted a government that genuinely works for them. The Saba Proclamation, drafted by the General People’s Congress, will finally allow for a new Yemen to rise from the ashes of the old."
YAR_Military_Tribal_Links:0 "Military-Tribal Links"
YAR_Military_Tribal_Links_desc:0 "The various tribes of Yemen have been a fading ally of the Al-Islah government for some time now, and having felt like a marginalized section of society for too long, many tribes are willing to secretly or even openly support us. By meeting with these tribesmen, we may be able to convince them to support our fight against the various factions of the civil war."
YAR_Iraq_Support:0 "Request Iraqi Support"
YAR_Iraq_Support_desc:0 "The Iraqi government under Saddam Hussein is one that is closely aligned to our own and potentially willing to support us. By sending a request for arms to the Iraqi government, our soldiers will receive much-needed equipment to fight against our enemies."
YAR_Jasmin_Crackdown:0 "Crackdown On The Jasmines"
YAR_Jasmin_Crackdown_desc:0 "The Jasmine Council and its supporters remain in fierce opposition to our government. Across the nation, pro-democratic protests and riots are held in an attempt to defy the new ruling government. By cracking down on their protests and making certain false promises, we may be able to placate this rebellion and bring stability to the streets once more."
YAR_Islamist_Crackdown:0 "Oust The Islamists"
YAR_Islamist_Crackdown_desc:0 "The Al-Islah government was a corrupt cabal that must be put on trial for their crimes against the Yemeni people. Most, if not all, members of the party were involved in some degree of corruption, and their Salafist allies were mere domestic terrorists bent on the total destruction of the Yemeni way of life. For the new Yemen to prosper, these Islamist dogs must be tried for their treachery."
YAR_Communist_Crackdown:0 "Hunt Down The Communists"
YAR_Communist_Crackdown_desc:0 "The Yemeni Socialist Party and its various communist counterparts have been a thorn in Yemen’s side since they were overthrown in the late 1980s. Unlike the Al-Islah government, we shall not allow their presence to continue. Already the police and Republican Guard have begun hunting down the remaining communists to finally remove them from our great country."
YAR_Unity_In_Government:0 "Unity In The National Government?"
YAR_Unity_In_Government_desc:0 "A unified coalition within the new Yemeni government has always been a difficult prospect to manage. The Houthis and Nasserists both have very different visions for Yemen in contrast to Saleh and the GCP. With the end of the civil war, nothing remains to unite our coalition, and already the Houthis and Nasserists have begun to waver in their loyalty to Saleh."
YAR_Questions_of_Loyalty:0 "Questions Of Loyalty"
YAR_Questions_of_Loyalty_desc:0 "With the Houthis found to be coordinating with the Nasserists, the once unified coalition now rests on shaky ground and has forced the hand of Saleh and the GCP to protect himself and the legitimate government of Yemen. A great game is beginning and it is unknown who will be its victor."
YAR_Game_of_Chess:0 "Game Of Chess"
YAR_Game_of_Chess_desc:0 "After weeks of planning and plotting against each other, our coalition has all but fallen apart, and the game of chess has finally begun. Whilst the battle for Yemen ended months ago, it has now returned. However, this time the battle will not be fought with men and bullets, but with promises and lies, and the victor will finally be able to claim Yemen as their own."
YAR_Houthi_Gamble:0 "The Houthi Gamble"
YAR_Houthi_Gamble_desc:0 "Both Saleh’s betrayal and his subsequent death have now allowed our forces to rise from mere coalition partners to the absolute rulers of Yemen. With the Nasserists now removed as serious political contenders, and trust in the General People’s Congress at an all-time low, our gamble has paid off and Yemen now belongs to al-Houthi."
YAR_Purge_GPC:0 "Purge The GPC"
YAR_Purge_GPC_desc:0 "If we are to control Yemen in its entirety, we must ensure that the political institutions are loyal to us. The GPC was an ally of Saleh, and through them, another revolution may occur. Therefore, in order to ensure that our rule over Yemen is secure, all members of the GPC must be placed under arrest and tried for their crimes."
YAR_Destroy_Corruption:0 "Destroy Corruption"
YAR_Destroy_Corruption_desc:0 "Corruption, by definition, is anti-Islamic. It is a tool devised by the weak to subvert the word of Allah. Both our government and the people are tired of such despicable tendencies, and in order to remove this blight from Yemen, anti-corruption courts will be established to deal with corruption wherever it is found and bring it to a swift end."
YAR_Uplift_Saada:0 "Uplift Saada"
YAR_Uplift_Saada_desc:0 "Under the Al-Islah government the once-prosperous region of Saada was abandoned and left to rot, and the recent internal battle against Saleh did very little to aid in its reconstruction. Now with the nation somewhat stable, we can begin the reconstruction of this region starting with repairing its damaged infrastructure and civilian economy."
YAR_Install_Loyal_Rule:0 "Install Loyal Local Rule"
YAR_Install_Loyal_Rule_desc:0 "In order to prevent the breakdown of our new society, local authorities must be absolutely loyal to both our administration and our ideals. Therefore, all members of local councils must strictly adhere to our manifesto and vision for Yemen, otherwise our new nation will succumb to failure and risk becoming a continuation of Al-Islah."
YAR_Curtail_Sheikhs:0 "Curtail The Sheikhs"
YAR_Curtail_Sheikhs_desc:0 "Various Sheikhs across Yemen still adhere to the anti-Islamic ways of corruption, and this simply cannot be allowed to continue. By establishing a secondary branch of the anti-corruption court we shall investigate reports of corruption amongst the Sheikhs and bring them to justice, whilst supporting those who remain loyal Muslims."
YAR_Restore_Democratic_Institutions:0 "Restore Democratic Institutions"
YAR_Restore_Democratic_Institutions_desc:0 "It is not our intention to remain dictators, rather we strive to become benevolent rulers. To support our legitimacy amongst the people, certain democratic elements shall be restored to Yemeni society, allowing for some to have a voice to speak against government policies. While we will grant this freedom enthusiastically, it is unlikely that we shall take to heart any such criticism."
YAR_Ensure_Ansar_Allah_Domination:0 "Ensure Ansar Allah Domination"
YAR_Ensure_Ansar_Allah_Domination_desc:0 "In order for Yemen to prosper, the Houthi government must remain in power. Under this benevolent dictatorship, the nation shall be protected from all manners of threats both internal and external. Whilst such an announcement may worry some members of the nation, in time they will realize the true benevolence of al-Houthi."
YAR_United_Faith:0 "United In Faith"
YAR_United_Faith_desc:0 "We are all Muslims. The vast majority of Yemeni citizens accept the word of Allah as truth and welcome him into their lives. The lies perpetuated by our opposition stating we wish to marginalize the Sunni Muslims is nothing more than slander. All we seek is for Zaidis to receive the respect they deserve. All Muslims are our brethren and it is time for all in our nation to recognize this."
YAR_Push_For_Decentralization:0 "Push For Decentralisation"
YAR_Push_For_Decentralization_desc:0 "Yemen is a vast nation, and if it is to be governed properly it must not be ruled by a single person. In order to prosper, Yemen must decentralise. The various tribes across Yemen will be granted the powers necessary to rule themselves whilst still remaining part of Yemen and swearing loyalty to al-Houthi."
YAR_Reform_Bureaucracy:0 "Reform The Bureaucracy"
YAR_Reform_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Qahtan and his Al-Islah party created a bloated and corrupt bureaucracy. The political machine of Yemen was rife with nepotism, hedonism, and countless other corrupt practices. This must end, and a reform of the bureaucracy must come sooner rather than later. Only through streamlining the political process will we be rid of Al-Islah’s policies, and only this way will true reform come to Yemen."
YAR_Denounce_Foreign_Powers:0 "Denounce Foreign Powers"
YAR_Denounce_Foreign_Powers_desc:0 "All the major powers of this world have sought to destroy Yemen. America, Canada and Britain, all supposed bastions of democracies, have brought ruin to our nation and their communist counterparts in Russia and Germany have done no better. Even Palestine remains under Zionist control. The new Yemen does not need these powers, and we shall refuse to cooperate with them."
YAR_Self_Sufficiency:0 "Self-Sufficiency"
YAR_Self_Sufficiency_desc:0 "Yemen has always been a nation capable of looking after itself. Yet the Al-Islah government refused to invest into the materials necessary to create a self-sufficient society. Our resources are plentiful and we do not need to rely on other nations for economic prosperity. By investing where Al-Islah failed, we will establish a self-sufficient nation free of international trade."
YAR_Houthi_Investment:0 "Houthi Investment Project"
YAR_Houthi_Investment_desc:0 "The nation is still struggling to fully recover from the effects of the civil war, and it is necessary for us to intervene in particular regions of Yemen else they end up in the same situation as Saada. If Yemen is to recover from the war it must be allowed to rebuild its civilian economy, and it is our right as the benevolent leaders we are to ensure that all of Yemen is brought into the new golden age."
YAR_Improve_Agriculture:0 "Improve Agricultural Output"
YAR_Improve_Agriculture_desc:0 "Agriculturally, we have always struggled to compete with our neighbours. Much of our nation is arid and lacks the capabilities to farm large quantities of crops. To rectify this blatant disregard for the people of Yemen by the Al-Islah government, new wells and irrigation projects will be established all across our nation to finally bring food to all and remove dirty drinking water from the most remote of villages."
YAR_Develop_Ore:0 "Develop Ore Deposits"
YAR_Develop_Ore_desc:0 "Mining in Yemen had slowed in its productivity at the turn of the new century and this worsened as time went on. Restarting such a vital industry and beginning the search for new resources across Yemen’s fertile soil will prove vital for any potential investors, and may finally allow us to achieve a truly self-sufficient economy."
YAR_Nationwide_Investments:0 "Nation-Wide Investments"
YAR_Nationwide_Investments_desc:0 "Various cities and towns across the nation still lack the necessary local industry needed to thrive. Furthermore, these cities lack the capabilities to defend themselves from the many enemies of Yemen. By investing across the country into both local and military industries, we can ensure the economy recovers and develops quicker than originally planned."
YAR_Soverign_Army:0 "A Sovereign Army"
YAR_Soverign_Army_desc:0 "To properly protect Yemen from our enemies, our standing army needs rigorous training. Only by revealing this rigorous training regime to our enemies near their border will we be able to remind them of our might and deter them from ever setting foot on our soil."
YAR_Teach_Children:0 "Teach Our Children"
YAR_Teach_Children_desc:0 "The future of the Houthi regime belongs not solely to al-Houthi but to the millions of children within Yemen’s borders, it is our duty as the benevolent rulers of this nation to ensure that the children of this country receive a proper education. By funding the development and construction of schools we can ensure that all of Yemen’s children receive the education they deserve."
YAR_Higher_Learning:0 "Develop Higher Learning"
YAR_Higher_Learning_desc:0 "Higher education, such as the various universities in the most populated cities in our nation, deserve more funding than what is presently provided to them. This new funding will be allocated to the universities' scientific departments to attract the brightest minds from across the nation to come and develop our scientific base."
YAR_Infastructure_Works:0 "Infrastructure Works"
YAR_Infastructure_Works_desc:0 "In order to truly connect the nation and bring every citizen under the rule of the Houthi government, hundreds of miles of new infrastructure must be laid connecting the smallest of villages to the largest of cities. Only with this infrastructure project will Yemen be able to, at last, connect as one."
YAR_Functioning_Public_Services:0 "Functioning Public Services"
YAR_Functioning_Public_Services_desc:0 "Much of the Yemeni public services have been abandoned since the turn of the century. The Al-Islah government had neglected them, failing to see their usefulness to Yemeni society. By channelling the desired funding into these public services our nation's most basic public services can finally prosper and give the people of Yemen a working public sector."
yar_friends_in_shia:0 "Friends In Shia"
yar_friends_in_shia_desc:0 "The Middle East is the birthplace of Islam, and of course the birthplace of the righteous followers of Ali, and it is only right that we extend our hand out to Shia nations in our region. Syria, Iran, Lebanon, and Azerbaijan are all friends to the Houthi government. We will reach out to these righteous nations and work towards closer geopolitical cooperation."
yar_mission_to_tehran:0 "Mission To Tehran"
yar_mission_to_tehran_desc:0 "Iran stands as the largest concentration of Shia believers, and also as the biggest roadblock against Saudi ambitions in the Middle East. We should send a mission of diplomats to establish close relations with the government in Tehran, to help secure the rightful place of the followers of Ali as the dominant force in the region."
yar_lebanese_approachment:0 "Approaching The Lebanese"
yar_lebanese_approachment_desc:0 "In Lebanon the Shia righteous live in an interesting predicament of pluralist living, mingling with the Sunni and Christians alike. We will reach out to the Lebanese government and attempt to establish closer relations, ensuring we can maintain an international image of stewardship over the Shia of the world."
yar_yareni_iranian_friendship_treaty:0 "Yemeni-Iranian Friendship Treaty"
yar_yareni_iranian_friendship_treaty_desc:0 "With the success of our diplomatic mission in the capital of Iran, we should now move forward to the natural conclusion of our efforts, and begin writing treaties that will put into legal documents our friendly relationship. A pact of non-aggression along with official trade policies will certainly be accepted by our new friends, and with the signing of this deal, our future will be all the more secure."
yar_a_shia_alliance:0 "A Shia Alliance?"
yar_a_shia_alliance_desc:0 "Only through the unification of the Shia people can we be safe from the tyranny of the imperialist nations across Europe and America. We shall counter their continued interference by establishing a new alliance, this “House of the Faithful” will unite the Arab world and keep it safe from the hands of the imperialists that have kept us down for centuries!"
iraqi_negotiations:0 "Iraqi Negotiations"
iraqi_negotiations_desc:0 "To further the cause of Shia cooperation within Arabia it is vital to ensure the loyalty of the Iraqi government. To ensure their loyalty our ambassadors shall begin negotiations with their government to ensure the beginning of a new era of friendship between us and our like-minded Shia brethren."
pursue_trade_relations:0 "Pursue Trade Relations?"
pursue_trade_relations_desc:0 "For centuries the Middle East has been under the boot of imperialists, and there is no worse form of imperialism than economic imperialism. If the Shia states of the Middle East are to be free, they must control their own economies. By trading amongst each other, we can ensure the imperialists of this world cannot control their economies as they have for centuries."
yar_questions_of_arabia:0 "Questions Of Arabia"
yar_questions_of_arabia_desc:0 "Arabia is a vast region and with the chaos that continues to engulf it our small state has the power to influence the future of our region. If we are to become the dominant force within Arabia, then we must take advantage of this chaos and decide how we are to dominate these vast deserts."
yar_fully_recognize_south_yaren:0 "Fully Recognise South Yemen"
yar_fully_recognize_south_yaren_desc:0 "Whilst the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen are our polar opposites, representing an evil form of government that has brought ruin to the world, they remain citizens of Yemen. Whilst we detest communism in all its forms, we cannot risk the outbreak of another Yemenite war. By reaching out to their President we shall hope to bring peace once more to both our states and end years of division."
yar_reintegrate_the_communists:0 "Reintegrate The Communists"
yar_reintegrate_the_communists_desc:0 "The People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen cannot be allowed to continue. Its existence is a blight on Arabia, representing one of the many evils of this world, and we cannot allow it to continue harming not only its citizens but our nation. Therefore, to ensure that Yemen is unified once more, we must strike first and ensure that communism in Yemen is eradicated before it has time to rebuild itself."
yar_omani_trade_deals:0 "Omani Trade Deals"
yar_omani_trade_deals_desc:0 "The Omani government is the only nation on our border that we would be willing to trade with, whilst not offering any new materials that we do not already have access to their resources may one day prove vital to our economy. By attempting to form new trade relations we can expand on our economy and ensure that Saudi dominance in our region continues to be stricken down."
yar_strike_at_oman:0 "Strike At Oman"
yar_strike_at_oman_desc:0 "In today’s age, the only way to ensure dominance is through force. The establishment of trade deals will only get us so far in our small corner of the world, with military intervention being the only language that Arabia understands. As our first act, the Omani government must be toppled and brought under our control, so as to control their industries for the sake of our own glory."
yar_embargo_the_saudis:0 "Embargo The Saudis"
yar_embargo_the_saudis_desc:0 "The Saudi goliath relies upon the exportation of oil to any state willing to purchase it. In an effort to promote self-sufficiency, and to purge the last remaining vestiges of Saudi influence from our government, we shall embargo the tyrants of Arabia hopefully inspiring others to do the same."
yar_defeat_the_saudi_goliath:0 "Defeat The Saudi Goliath"
yar_defeat_the_saudi_goliath_desc:0 "Our industries stand ready, our armies mobilized and the people prepared for the upcoming struggle. Today the war of national liberation begins, and today the Saudi Arabian goliath shall, at last, be destroyed and brought under our control. At the end of this war, we shall stand as the new hegemon of Arabia with none left to oppose us."

yar_peace_for_yaren_desc:0 "We have risen to prominence in Arabia and Yemen can no longer be viewed as the rump state of our region.

The future, at last, looks bright as peace in our time has been enshrined for all."
YAR_Successor:0 "The Successor"
YAR_Successor_desc:0 "President Ahmed Saleh walks in the footsteps of his father, the great Ali Abdullah Saleh who guided our nation through its darkest days in the previous century. The press has even taken to simply calling him the ‘Successor.’ He will surely make his father proud!"
YAR_Purge_Nasserites:0 "Purge The Nasserites"
YAR_Purge_Nasserites_desc:0 "Despite their supposed patriotism, the Nasserists are really no different from the American-influenced Al-Islah or the communist controlled Southern movement. If they had their way, they would enslave the people to the dogma of an Egyptian ideology instead of serving them with a Yemeni one."
YAR_Destroy_Houthi_Menace:0 "Destroy The Houthi Menace"
YAR_Destroy_Houthi_Menace_desc:0 "President Saleh has noted that, other than being Zaidi Shia instead of Sunni, there are very few differences between Ansar Allah and the salafists who supported the vile Al-Islah regime. If we do not take action, they could push Yemen into the pit of theocratic darkness at any second."
YAR_Total_GPC_Control:0 "Total GPC Control"
YAR_Total_GPC_Control_desc:0 "President Saleh is a great man with so many plans for Yemen but he needs the support of the parliament if he is to make them into a reality. What better way to do that than to give every member of the government free membership in the General People’s Congress? It’s an offer they cannot refuse."
YAR_Reinforce_Tribal_Alliances:0 "Reinforce Tribal Alliances"
YAR_Reinforce_Tribal_Alliances_desc:0 "The unsung bedrock of Yemeni society are its tribesmen. Though many found themselves as our enemies in the recent conflict, we should ensure that those who are left do not feel sidelined in our nation."
YAR_Mass_Fund_the_Army:0 "Mass Fund The Army"
YAR_Mass_Fund_the_Army_desc:0 "The armed forces are the only truly reliable protectors and servants of the Yemeni populace. As such, we should make sure that they have all the funding that they need and then some even if it means certain other programs may have to do without."
YAR_Local_Development_Agencies:0 "Local Development Agencies"
YAR_Local_Development_Agencies_desc:0 "President Saleh knows that any good administration remains close to its people. To do this he has called for the creation of local development agencies in each governorate to hear the needs of each and every citizen."
YAR_Full_Military_Industrial_Complex:0 "Full Military-Industrial Complex"
YAR_Full_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc:0 "What good is extra money if there is nothing to spend it on? We should shift more of our industrial assets towards defense production to ensure the army never has to do without necessary equipment. Our dear president may even see a financial windfall in his stock portfolio."
YAR_Mass_Infastructure_Works:0 "Mass Infrastructure Works"
YAR_Mass_Infastructure_Works_desc:0 "President Saleh recently declared it his intention to, as he put it, ‘build back better’ after the Second Yemeni Civil War which means rebuilding and expanding Yemeni infrastructure like never before."

YAR_Faith_In_Allah:0 "Faith In Allah"
YAR_Faith_In_Allah_desc:0 "You do not need to be a Salafist fanatic or a Houthis zealot to be a good Muslim. A good Muslim works closely with his government to create a better society. In fact, a perfect example of Islam put into practice is President Saleh who diligently works for Yemen every day."
YAR_Traditional_Gender_Roles:0 "Traditional Gender Roles"
YAR_Traditional_Gender_Roles_desc:0 "One we can get particularly religious Yemenis on our side is to reaffirm the proper role of men and women in our society. Men work for the betterment of the nation and women work for the betterment of the family."
YAR_New_Industrial_Hubs:0 "New Industrial Hubs"
YAR_New_Industrial_Hubs_desc:0 "Currently our industry is very spread out with refineries and factories being located very far from where the resources are extracted. Saleh has ordered the creation of new industrial parks near mines and oil fields to make the process easier."
YAR_Develop_Tourism_Sector:0 "Develop The Tourism Sector"
YAR_Develop_Tourism_Sector_desc:0 "Given our recent history, it is understandable why tourists avoid Yemen. A new tourism campaign called Experience Yemen should change their minds and soon they flock in droves to see the historic Dar al-Hajar and the exotic beauty of Socotra Island."
YAR_Upgrade_Sanaa_Airport:0 "Upgrade Sana'a Airport"
YAR_Upgrade_Sanaa_Airport_desc:0 "Much of Sanaa International Airport was destroyed during the fighting with runways covered in bomb craters and terminals that have become refugee housing. We should restore this so the country can be more easily accessed by the outside world again."

YAR_Culture_of_Corruption:0 "Culture Of Corruption"
YAR_Culture_of_Corruption_desc:0 "Corruption is a word that many Yemenis associate with the Al-Islah regime. While true, Al-Islah’s mistake was that they used corruption to benefit only themselves rather than the people as well. It is a good thing that President Saleh knows better than them."
YAR_Open_For_Buisness:0 "Open For Business!"
YAR_Open_For_Buisness_desc:0 "In addition to Experience Yemen, another media campaign specifically targeted at corporations will let them know that Yemen is no longer a haven of civil unrest. Yemen: come spend your money here!"
YAR_Salehs_Personal_Gold_Mine:0 "Saleh's Personal Gold Mine"
YAR_Salehs_Personal_Gold_Mine_desc:0 "President Saleh and his family have been the humble servants of the Yemeni people for many decades and have asked for very little in return. It is only right and fair that they receive just compensation for all their selfless efforts."
YAR_Global_Tax_Haven:0 "Global Tax Haven"
YAR_Global_Tax_Haven_desc:0 "The upper-classes of the world need a place to keep their wealth hiding from the prying eyes of their governments. President Saleh aims to help them by making Yemen into the Switzerland of the Middle East."

 YAR.1.t:0 "The Die is Cast"
 YAR.1.d:0 "In a move that shocked the nation, Ahmed Saleh, heir of Abdullah Ali Saleh, commander of the Republican Guard, Supreme Leader of the General People’s Congress, was in open revolt against the ruling Al-Islah party. Having been dethroned since the devastating election loss in 2005 against the Al-Islah party, and the betrayal of Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, his father’s once trusted advisor, Saleh had begun planning for revenge and a chance to gain power once more. In a rally at the city of Ma’rib, Saleh exclaimed that “No more would the GPC be relegated to a junior-partner to corrupt Islamists and zealots, but it would reclaim its glory, its power, all under the vision and guidance of Saleh’s Grand Coalition”. Comprising of the Nasserist Union People’s Organization, a radical socialist pan-Arabist party and the Ansar Allah movement, a nationalist Zaydi party, this Coalition would propel Yemen towards the future. As the people cheered and militias and Republican Guard army units assembled, Saleh set his sights to Sana’a, and to victory."
 YAR.1.o1:0 "This is for you, father."

 YAR.2.t:0 "The Saba Proclamation"
 YAR.2.d:0 "At a rally attended by thousands of GPC supporters, Houthis, and Nasserists, Ahmed Saleh has proclaimed to the Yemeni people that their country would soon be totally rid of the numerous enemies to its sovereignty, promising to “utterly annihilate” all enemies he believes to pose a threat to the nation and his regime. The newly sworn-in president proceeded to explain at great lengths his decision to betray Qahtan’s government, calling upon all patriotic Yemenis to back his side in the coming civil war, regardless of their past loyalties. Saleh also furiously denounced the involvement of foreign powers, calling out the Warsaw Pact for its unconditional backing of Marxist rebels in the south as well as Saudi support for the “decrepit” Al-Islah government. At the end of the speech, a young Republican Guard enlistee was invited to the stage to speak of the tragic death of his entire family at the hands of Islamists through the use of a car bomb at his village’s market. With the rally only ending at the end of the day, a news crew of the BBC would take a picture that would define the conflict in the international consciousness, of a veiled mother giving her son, a soldier in the Republican Guard, a tearful goodbye as they headed off to the front, fighting for a new Yemen."
 YAR.2.o1:0 "Yemen is calling its sons and patriots. For Saleh!"

 YAR.3.t:0 "Talk with the Tribes"
 YAR.3.d:0 "Today, late at night at a small remote village just outside the city of Ma’rib, Ahmed Saleh convened with a plethora of tribal representatives, most importantly the sheikh of the Bakil Confederation, Sinan bin Abdullah bin Saleh Abu Lahoum. In recent years, the Bakil had backed the GPC in face of growing Hashidi support for Al-Islah, but the sheikh had not yet commented on Saleh’s rebellion. Surrounded by tribal sheikhs, Saleh pleaded that the GPC had always been a staunch ally of the tribes, and promised greater political and economic affluence for those tribes that supported his effort. Lahoum then replied that all present had already made up their mind as many of the tribes felt marginalised and left behind out of economic investments, with the Hashidis enriching and empowering themselves too greatly. With tribal bodyguards firing off their guns into the air in celebration, the sheikhs, Lahoum and Ahmed Saleh drank in celebration of their cooperation, all pledging their full support to the war effort and seeing Saleh’s coalition to victory. "
 YAR.3.o1:0 "We have the pillars of society on our side."

 YAR.4.t:0 "Lunch in Baghdad"
 YAR.4.d:0 "Today, on a visit to the Republican Palace, President Ahmed Saleh of the Yemen Arab Republic arrived to meet with President [IRQ.Getleader]. Having managed to smuggle himself out of his war torn country to visit with our President himself, Saleh urged President [IRQ.Getleader] to aid in the war effort against the Al-Islah government and various other factions that have now risen up across the nation. Over a meal the two discussed the history of their two nations relations reminding one another how Abdullah Saleh had supported the invasion of Kuwait and that up until the North Yemen civil war the two countries had enjoyed cordial relations. Having finished their meal Saleh once again turned the conversation back to Iraqi support in the war. With Saleh’s control over the rural regions of the nation, it seems unlikely that his industry will be able to support a continued war effort with a decisive victory needed within the coming months if he is to be successful. Whilst a single shipment of armaments would improve Saleh’s chances of victory it may not be enough to grant him the rapid advance needed, but a single tank division would. However, aiding Saleh may have no clear benefits as his loose coalition may soon collapse. Now after much debate, our policy for Yemen has been determined."
 YAR.4.o1:0 "Yemen shall receive arms and equipment"
 YAR.4.o2:0 "A tank division shall suffice"
 YAR.4.o3:0 "We have no interest in securing their victory"

 YAR.5.t:0 "Iraq Agrees to Send Armaments"
 YAR.5.d:0 "Today, Ahmed Saleh has successfully returned from Iraq following meetings with President [IRQ.Getleader] discussing their potential support for our continuing war effort. Having once again smuggled himself back into the country, President Saleh landed in a makeshift airport in an Iraqi cargo plane which opened revealing the President and crates full of weapons and other support equipment. With the President of Iraq having agreed to Saleh’s requests for immediate support in the civil war, various arms and armaments have now begun being shipped across the front line with soldiers now replenishing depleted ammunition and continuing to shell enemy held cities and towns. Whilst it is unknown how long this new found equipment will last us with leading generals believing that if used conservatively the equipment may be able to support our war effort for another few months. Having agreed with his generals, the President now has begun plans to see that the war ends within this timeframe seeking to strike a decisive blow against the remaining factions across the nation."
 YAR.5.o1:0 "This equipment shall guide us to victory!"

 YAR.6.t:0 "Iraq Agrees to Send Tank Support"
 YAR.6.d:0 "Today, Ahmed Saleh has successfully returned from Iraq following meetings with President [IRQ.Getleader] discussing their potential support for our continuing war effort. Having once again smuggled himself back into the country, President Saleh landed in a makeshift airport in an Iraqi cargo plane which opened revealing the President and four tanks. Overhead a further five Iraqi cargo planes circled to land each carrying four tanks, more than enough for a single tank company. With this support from the Iraqi government our leading generals have now predicted that, if used correctly and efficiently, this tank company will be able to give our nation a significant upper hand against our foes. Already plans have been drawn up to begin a rapid advance deep into the heart of our enemies territory, hopefully being enough to cripple their industries and capture their government forcing them to surrender. However, with no industry to support the replaced tanks our generals have raised concerns over losses of individual tanks with the President himself agreeing that if victory is to be achieved minimum losses must be suffered to this tank company."
 YAR.6.o1:0 "Now begins a swift advance across the nation."

 YAR.7.t:0 "Stability in the Streets"
 YAR.7.d:0 "Today, during a protest from supporters of the defeated Jasmine Council, Saleh proved his willingness to enforce stability at any costs when he ordered local police in Aden to crack down on the largely peaceful protesters. This comes as a bit of a shock to Yemenis who had read a widely circulated official interview Saleh had with the editor of the General People’s Congress’s newspaper, Al Motamar, where he promised among other things the coming of free and fair elections to Yemen after the civil war. Even more worrisome is the creation of the ‘Central Security Organization’, an intelligence agency drawing from the Republican Guard and local police forces, with the goal of “preserving internal peace and stability”. Now many Yemenis wonder whether Saleh will hold true to his earlier statements of democracy, while the GPC seems to ever increase its efforts to centralize power around itself and its leader."
 YAR.7.o1:0 "Surely there is nothing to worry about?"

 YAR.8.t:0 "Beginning of Anti-Corruption Trials"
 YAR.8.d:0 "Dozens of individuals who composed the nucleus of the Al-Islah movement's leadership have been held in a top-secret detention facility ever since the defeat of Qahtan’s government. Today, this changes, as Saleh announced the beginning of official trials that would see these "corrupt hucksters" brought to justice before the newly formed Supreme Court. Among those who will be on trial are the leaders of Al-Islah's various factions, as well as some less well known senior political and military leaders of the republic. A notable exception is Mohammed Qahtan, who had been assassinated by a Houthi sniper several weeks ago while his column fled the capture of Sana'a. Although most defendants are expected to be simply sentenced to prison on charges ranging from embezzlement to sectarianism, rumors are spreading that the prosecution is pursuing a death sentence for the influential and radical Salafist cleric Abdul Majeed Al-Zindadi. While this decision will most likely upset the more radical Sunni elements of the population, it seems Saleh will no longer take precautions when persecuting the enemy he once called his allies."
 YAR.8.o1:0 "Good riddance."
 
 YAR.9.t:0 "Anti-Insurgency Activity Increased"
 YAR.9.d:0 "Even though the marxist rebels were mostly routed after their defeat in the civil war, pockets of resistance remain active, harassing army convoys and local police. Now, President Saleh has announced that hundreds of extra security and military personnel will be sent to the region to “destroy those who continue to threaten the sovereignty of the Yemeni people.” Some MPs doubted this strategy as the earlier government tried and failed to pacify the region, suggesting a more reconciliatory approach, but Saleh was adamant that the rebels must be destroyed once and for all. Already thousands of communist fighters have been detained in provisional camps, with more to follow once the anti-insurgency presence ramps up further. Saleh also stated that he would not only continue the ban on the Yemeni Socialist Party, but place bans on any mass organizations with suspected ties to the YSP, such as trade unions, women and youth groups, and other “puppets of the radical Marxists”. Meanwhile, the international response is largely critical, raising concerns over the government’s methods, with far-left nations in particular calling the process unfair and a potential concern for human rights abuses. "
 YAR.9.o1:0 "The YSP's days are finally numbered."

 YAR.10.t:0 "Houthis Request Meeting with GPC Leadership"
 YAR.10.d:0 "Ever since the conclusion of the civil war, there has been an uneasy relationship between the General People's Congress and its allies. Influential cabinet positions have gone to Saleh’s inner circle in the GPC, while many concessions made to the Nasserists and Houthis have so far not been addressed. In order to resolve this tension, the leadership of Ansar Allah has requested for an official meeting with President Saleh and his cabinet. Individuals close to Abdul-Malik al-Houthi claim his focus during the meeting will be on discussing joint reconstruction efforts, as well as matters of religious education and regional autonomy for the governorate of Saada. And hopefully by doing so, the meeting could reaffirm the alliance between the parties, and strengthen the internal stability of the coalition."
 YAR.10.o1:0 "We cannot remain silent when the fate of our movement remains on the line."

 YAR.11.t:0 "Saleh Rejects Houthi Request for Meeting"
 YAR.11.d:0 "After days of silence from his presidential office, Ahmed Saleh has rejected Ansar Allahs’ request for a meeting to discuss reconstruction and reforms. In a memo full of strong language sent to the leader of the Houthis, the president claimed his trusted advisors were more than capable of handling reconstruction efforts on their own and have more important things to do than to “discuss pointless religious tribulations”, instead accusing the Houthis of stirring up sectarian conflicts by prioritizing Zaydi needs over the needs of the entire country. Needless to say, many senior Houthi leaders were shocked by the inflammatory rejection, feeling a sense of being purposefully locked out of matters of internal policy. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi is reportedly keeping all options on the table, but as it becomes ever acutely clearer that the GPC is more inclined to chart a course for the nation on the GPCs terms alone, the possibilities for a Houthi-GPC split seems to be more and more potent.  "
 YAR.11.o1:0 "Just promise them a big sum of money for their province, that’ll shut them up."

 YAR.12.t:0 "Nasserists Found Discussing with Houthis"
 YAR.12.d:0 "During a routine late-night sweep of the suburbs of the capital, a security and intelligence unit relayed to the chief of staff the discovery and observation of a secret meeting between prominent military commanders from the Ansar Allah and Nasserist Union militia organisations. Listening to the conversation, the meeting was apparently to discuss anti-insurgency operations in the city of Sana’a against suspected Jasmine and YSP cells. While on the surface, this is not controversial in itself, but as the commander points out, the areas discussed had been cleared of suspected insurgent activity weeks ago, and involved places regarding political, justiciary and press-related buildings. Furthermore, the fact that no representatives from the Republican Guard were present at all would be cause for concern, as the Guard is responsible for overseeing insurgent activity. Having heard this, many in the cabinet are beginning to speculate that this is only the tip of the iceberg, and that the Houthis and Nasserists interactions go much deeper."
 YAR.12.o1:0 "I want them shadowed at every opportunity. Find out what they are planning!"

 YAR.13.t:0 "Breakdown of the Coalition"
 YAR.13.d:0 "As tensions continue to heighten throughout the country, a devastating intelligence report has come to the desk of president Saleh. It details the conversations of several high-ranking Ansar Allah and Nasserist Union politicians, discussing common grievances with Ahmed Saleh’s rule of governance, especially our apparent disregard for their concerns. Even more worrisome is the discussion about a possible alliance between the two to unseat the “increasingly authoritarian” Saleh and enact their own policy goals. Naturally, the president has gone into a fit of rage, railing against his “supposed good for nothing allies”, ordering the arrest of all those discovered in the plot. However, it appears as though there was a breach of information, and both Houthi and Nasserist senior officials have scattered to the wind, unable to be found by our security forces. Sporadic clashes between militia and police forces are now occurring across the nation, and with the threat of another rebellion incoming, the fate of Ahmed Saleh’s presidency is now at stake."
 YAR.13.o1:0 "If the snakes want to bite, I’ll just have to bite back."

 YAR.14.t:0 "Houthi Leadership Makes Its Choice"
 YAR.14.d:0 "As clashes around the country continue to escalate, the Houthi leadership has been hidden well away in the remote reaches of Saada from the prying eyes of more aggressive security forces. Faced with the de facto certainty of a renewed conflict, there has been a ferocious debate amongst the movement about what to do next. The majority want to continue with the current course of actions and to continue their alliance with the Nasserists, while a vocal minority despises the secular socialism of said faction and wants to negotiate with the Saleh regime. Coincidentally, this minority is in contact with moderate cabinet members close to president Saleh, who have promised near total autonomy for Saada province and exuberant government investment funds to be allocated to the struggling region. However, many simply do not trust the GPC to uphold its lofty promises and prefer to instead commit to the alliance with the Nasserists, who despite their secular socialism policies have multiple points of shared interests and agreements with Ansar Allah, such as a focus on national self sufficiency, democracy and local autonomy. Eventually, a vote was held among the leadership and the Houthis decided..."
 YAR.14.o1:0 "We shall strike a deal with Saleh"
 YAR.14.o2:0 "We shall unite in rebellion against that little dictator"

 YAR.15.t:0 "Houthis Declare Allegiance to Saleh"
 YAR.15.d:0 "In a shocking move to much of the Yemeni population, the Houthis have declared their allegiance to President Saleh and the General People’s Congress. The main cause of the Houthis’ last minute refusal of defection seems to stem from a set of wide-ranging concessions Saleh has promised to the Houthis, including regional autonomy and religious education, alongsides with massive investments favoring Zaidi minority development. Many rank-and-file Houthis are doubtful of the President’s intentions, but the majority of the Movement’s supporters have accepted the decisions of the leadership and are preparing to rally in support of Saleh’s president and against those who wish to see him gone. Outrage and confusion is taking hold within the Nasserists, who have now been forced into a corner as they prepare to face their former allies alone, without help from any major political factions inside the country. Meanwhile, Houthi militias are beginning to collaborate with government forces in the repression of anti-Saleh protests in the capital as well as cities around the country. "
 YAR.15.o1:0 "The Houthis have finally come to their senses."

 YAR.16.t:0 "Houthis Declare Alliance with Nasserists"
 YAR.16.d:0 "In a public statement released across the nation, Abdel Malek Al-Houthi proclaimed Ansar Allah’s unilateral political and military alliance with the Nasserist Union People’s Organization, and declared that there was no more chance of reconciliation with the General People’s Congress. He strongly denounced the authoritarian actions of the “merciless” Ahmed Saleh and his “party of sycophants'', whom the Houthis claimed did not represent the “true will” of the country, and called on all members of the Houthi movement to rise up in a general intifada against the sitting regime. Already, protests across the country are swelling in size, with Houthi supporters joining Nasserists, Jasmine Movement supporters, and other anti-Saleh elements in their calls for the downfall of the regime. Clashes continue to escalate around Yemen between armed organizations representing the government and its former allies, but all eyes are set on the capital, where growing protests could make or break the rebellion against Saleh’s rule."
 YAR.16.o1:0 "The Congress and its tyrant leader will be done away with."

 YAR.17.t:0 "Death of the Houthis"
 YAR.17.d:0 "With the alliance between the fellow self-proclaimed nationalists brokered and any past grievances washed away in cooperation, an air of jubilation hung over the Houthis as they could finally have their grievances addressed and those of the Zaydi faith restored to prominence. Yet as the militias finished rounding up the socialists they once beheld as possible allies and order was restored to the streets, Republican Guard and police security forces suddenly pulled out their guns on their supposed alliance partners. In an ironic twist of fate, Ansar Allah politicians, generals and militia members were rounded up in a nation-wide crackdown, the order having been personally ordered by Saleh himself. In the late evening, the president gave a televised address to the public, stating that his intelligence network had uncovered evidence of a coup against his government being organized, thus deeming Ansar Allah a threat to the Yemeni state. Shockingly, video images of a drone strike on a location in Saada were shown, followed by the bloodied corpse of Abdel Malik Al-Houthi being paraded around. As the arrests continue on and the last vestiges of possible opposition are being wiped out, there is no telling what Saleh will do next."
 YAR.17.o1:0 "This game is played. I win."

 YAR.18.t:0 "The Snake is Brought to Light"
 YAR.18.d:0 "As the crackdowns against the Nasserists continue on, Houthi leaders have remained on edge with their new supposed allies, whose apparent opportunism has drawn criticism from many Houthi members. However, it would only be during a routine inspection of a strange nondescript truck exiting the capital by Houthi militia members that the ball really got rolling. What was presumed to be a truck carrying Nasserist fighters actually turned out to be a storage truck filled with sensitive documents to be disposed of outside the city, possessing information on the activities, names and locations of Houthi politicians and generals, as well as financial details and certain “contingency plans”, one apparently already being put into effect. Enraged by this discovery, the Houthi leadership convened and decided to bide their time for an organised destruction of the treacherous Saleh cronies."
 YAR.18.o1:0 "Saleh’s betrayal will be punished by the hands of Allah’s will."

 YAR.19.t:0 "Republican Guard Triumphs in Sana’a"
 YAR.19.d:0 "After the order was given to fire upon protestors attempting to storm the Presidential Palace, chaos and carnage spread through the streets of Sana’a as Republican Guard army units entered the city and violently dispersed the crowds. Despite the throwing of stones and molotovs in defiance of their attackers, the sheer firepower was too much and soon the streets were cleared. The largest bloodbath occurred outside the Palace, with an estimated 14 dead and 37 wounded in the commotion, among which 5 children. As the crowds in San’aa wither away, the Republican Guard and the city’s police have already detained hundreds of protesters linked to anti-Saleh organizations. A wide range of criticism has been hurled at the government, from Jasmines accusing the government of human rights violations to Nasserist allegations that police target working class protesters regardless of their political affiliation, but the tide has seemed to turn. In a live address to the nation, Saleh praised the work of the Guard in successfully containing “foreign influenced radicals'', defending the decision to fire upon the crowd as “beating down rebel would-be destroyers of our nation’s unity”, promising a swift return to stability."
 YAR.19.o1:0 "Those dogs are beaten back!"

 YAR.20.t:0 "The Sana’a Revolution"
 YAR.20.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, protesters before the Presidential Palace in Sana'a were let through onto the Palace premises after the security commander in charge ordered his men to lay down their arms, in defiance of President Saleh’s orders to fire upon the unarmed citizens. Reports coming in from the scene showed the entire Palace being occupied, with activist leaders waving the Red Banner while standing on the balcony overlooking the streets, announcing the defeat of the dictator and the victory of the people’s revolution to the jubilation of the crowd below. President Saleh himself reportedly escaped via a rooftop helicopter, but was apprehended at the landing site just fifty kilometers outside the city proper. With the wannabe dictator apprehended and members of his cabinet and the GPC party being arrested left and right, the Nasserist Unionist People’s Organization and Ansar Allah have begun coalition talks as the only two remaining legitimate members of the alliance, preparing the way to a government for the people and by the people, as a new dawn rises over the nation of Yemen."
 YAR.20.o1:0 "The tyrant has been toppled, and a new era begins."

 YAR.21.t:0 "Tying Up Loose Ends"
 YAR.21.d:0 "With the country returning to stability and approval of the new regime increasing steadily, the faction leaders of the Houthis have concluded that prudence was not required anymore. In fact, now was the time for action, for otherwise the remnants of the putrid GPC might develop into a virulent disease spreading its impurity throughout this new nation. The ensuing wave of arrests was only partially successful: whereas Yahya Mohamed Abdullah Saleh has been convicted and is currently awaiting trial for crimes against the Yemeni people, others, such as Huda al-Baan, managed to escape the authorities by crossing the border towards Saudi Arabia or, in Huda al-Baan’s case, Iraq. Despite the possibility of these traitors providing valuable intel to less than cooperative neighbours, President Al-Houthi claims that those who did not escape will serve either life sentences or be promptly executed, serving as a sufficient reminder for all those who wish to openly defy the new legitimate government of Yemen."
 YAR.21.o1:0 "The opponents of our government will no longer harm us."

 YAR.22.t:0 "Establishment of Special Anti-Corruption Courts:"
 YAR.22.d:0 "Crime is an impure act condemned by Allah, and corruption is merely another example of it. The misguided Islamists of Al-Islah did not show any desire of tackling the issue, actively encouraging the practice in some circumstances, and now in an effort to cleanse politics and the nation of this blight President [YAR.Getleader] has now announced the establishment of anti-corruption courts which have been tasked with routing out the vestiges of corruption from all corners of the nation. Whilst the religious aspect of this policy has been noted by the population, with many accepting the new Islamic laws enshrined across the nation, many have also recognised that the President aims to repair relations between the government and the people as, since the election of the Al-Islah government in 2005, corruption has remained a prevalent issue amongst the people. With these courts already having proven efficient, with hundreds of arrests already being carried out across the nation, the government's war on corruption has begun with tremendous success with many confident in the capabilities of these courts to root out corruption once and for all."
 YAR.22.o1:0 "Fewer crooks in our government."

 YAR.23.t:0 "Saada Shows Signs of Recovery"
 YAR.23.d:0 "From a glorious city to a land of ruin, Saada’s history is complicated to say the least. Originally intended to be one of Yemen’s golden provinces, its spark has been tarnished by conflict, as the government often struck there when attempting to dislodge the Houthi community. Over time, rebuilding was deemed not worth the effort, for who knew when more violence would take place. However, now that the persecuted are in charge, the answer has become clear: never again. With these words echoing across the government, reconstruction of the province has now officially begun. Effective immediately, the government has begun providing the province with  aid ranging from construction workers to begin repairing damaged housing to trucks of food and grain to aid in the rebirth of the region's agricultural sector. With the people thanking the government for this ongoing investment, it has already become clear that the scars of the civil war have now faded, and that in time the golden province of Yemen will at last return bringing the economy a significant boost along with it."
 YAR.23.o1:0 "We would never leave our brothers in the mud."

 YAR.24.t:0 "Establishing Local Houthi Councils"
 YAR.24.d:0 "Sin always leaves a mark wherever it goes, and in the Yemeni government’s case, it seems that the stain was simply too big to be erased. For this reason, the rotten carcass has been replaced by a new system of governance that should help the central authority in its course of action: a group of local councils ordered to deal with reconstruction, the judiciary and even replace some of Al-Houthi’s power in governance. The intent is to create a somewhat decentralized ruling body whose priority would be transparency in their decisions, thus breaking the mold established by the former leaders. However, one cannot help but notice that among the sidelined factions are not only the GPC and Al-Islah, but also the liberal Jasmines, who had showed nothing but support for the leader’s pretense of democracy, though perhaps their desire of a secular republic is the reason why they were prevented from taking part in the movement. With accusations of favouritism already floating above the councils’ metaphorical head, one can already expect the road toward Yemeni freedom to be bumpy."
 YAR.24.o1:0 "They should not worry too much about it… We know what’s best."

 YAR.25.t:0 "Countering the Corrupt Sheikhs’ Power"
 YAR.25.d:0 "Despite some of the loyalists of this new government claiming that the Nasserists went too far in their condemnation of the global elite, a consensus has now been reached that, in order to put an end to the oppression the country’s religious communities have suffered daily, heavy restraints are to be put on the upper class, namely the sheikhs. The abuse of their power has been proven by their wavering loyalty, as they followed only whoever offered them the greater immediate benefits. Therefore, with a population supporting us through thick and thin, we can afford to expand our anti-corruption program towards these influential men and expose to a bewildered audience all the riches they took away from our cities most in need. They will be put through fair trials while their prized possessions are appropriated and instead offered to their more reasonable rivals. This should also serve as a reminder to the sheikhs who did join the Houthis: fall in line and obey, for you never know when your turn might come…"
 YAR.25.o1:0 "Weak loyalty requires a heavy-handed response."

 YAR.26.t:0 "Drop in Sectarian Violence"
 YAR.26.d:0 "Right from the start, it was expected by the international community that the rise of a religious minority, the Zaidis, to an undeniable position of domination amongst the political climate of Yemen would be the cause of numerous headaches. However, as the papers report, perhaps they were wrong. As order returns to the nation following the civil war, executives of our government have compiled as much data as possible on the ethnic violence taking place in the nation, and though the numbers often clashed, they saw a drastic decrease in quantity from the moment Al-Houthi gave his speech in Saada. In between praise for the reconstruction of the region, he took advantage of the amount of people watching him to lay upon his plans for the Sunni: nothing. He was not going to intervene and change their ways of life, for he claimed that his people understood what it meant to be repressed. From then on, his message of Islamic unity has been spread throughout the nation, which has now resonated with the population as the people have grown more united. Despite this, foreign observers have accused the reports of highlighting only positive results in order to hide the fact that other minorities, most notably the Jews, still must fear for their lives day by day, as the radicals have simply changed targets."

 YAR.27.d:0 "Pursuing the line of conduct that has been followed ever since the establishment of the tribal councils, the federal government has announced the beginning of a gradual process leading to what has been nicknamed “tribal decentralization”. The intent is very simple: recognizing the legitimacy of all constituencies of Yemen for self-rule, they shall be granted local parliaments as well as increased power that will go towards the Councils, thus ensuring that no matter what may occur, the immediate needs of a certain tribe will be met in record time. Most of the Yemenis, who in the past have shown more loyalty towards the local politicians than a central authority, have welcomed this change. The country is still in no way a confederal system, however; most federal services are still within federal hands, with the latter having shown no sign of wanting to collaborate with other forms of ideologies."

 YAR.28.d:0 "Modern times have been less than decent for the Arab people. Shunned by all forms of superpowers, whose greed for our precious minerals, whether they be solid or liquid like the infamous black gold, led to countless acts of violence against the Middle East. For the regions that inhabit it, such as Yemen, the pretense of ideology, a word invented by the Western world, is simply an excuse to pursue even more imperialism. Therefore in an address to the nation, President Al-Houthi has now condemned them all, the liberals of Canada and Britain just as much as the red conquerors that represent Germany and the Soviets. To preserve the independence of his country, the leader officially announced a new era of isolationism to remove the “outsider’s blight”. Denunciation was also applied to the American Republic for being the remnant of the original oppressor, the American hegemony, as well as Palestine for betraying the Arabic cause by aligning itself with the Zionist threat. The leader ended his statement by offering, “in his magnanimity”, a peaceful stand with the Jewish minority in Yemen’s population if they resettle back in Palestine."

Left in shambles after the brutal civil war that overtook the country, these places are now bustling with life thanks to the support of the Houthis’ investment project, which consists of several direct investments into a number of cities and provinces. To ensure the process goes as smoothly as possible, a decision was made to reinforce the authority of the local development associations so they may implement economic projects with a higher efficiency. The generosity of the government has not remained unnoticed, and our economy is booming. More importantly, with corruption a thing of the past, it is expected that the excess of money will go directly towards the people’s pockets."

Having promised near free reign over the matters of the local economy, President Al-Houthi has demanded only one concession from the various Houthi councils in exchange for this funding, a gradual increase in the military capabilities of each region allowing for the build-up of the armed forces. After very little discussion between the President and the Houthi councils, with only a few objecting due to concerns over the civilian sector falling behind, all of the councils had agreed to prioritise military build-up alongside the further build-up of the infrastructure within their local region. With each individual region now being granted the necessary funding to achieve this build-up, with selected regions being granted further aid to abet the fears of the civilian economy falling behind, the President is convinced that this build-up will lead to Yemen becoming an economic powerhouse on the Arabian peninsula."

With this now a reality, generals and field marshals from across the nation have approached the President stating that if Yemen is to survive it must reform the current state of the army and move away from the militia system, establishing an official standing army. Having agreed to these proposals, with the promise that the Houthis can maintain control over the affairs of the military, the President has now granted leading generals access to the Houthi militia in the hopes that they can be reformed into an elite standing army ready to serve and protect Yemen at a moment's notice. Therefore, beginning at today, the military is to begin training near the Saudi Arabian border in an effort to both reform itself into an elite force and to demonstrate to the Saudi goliath that their control over Yemen is now in the past and that any attempts to revive such influence will be met with a retaliatory strike that will see them defeated once and for all."

Whilst many within our government support accepting this request for diplomatic and economic aid from the Houthi government, there are those within our government who oppose this plan. Those in opposition to this plan believe that whilst it is true that the imperialist powers of the world seek to dominate the Middle East once more, the Houthi government cannot be trusted to safeguard the Middle East given their treatment of those opposed to them.

Now, to the surprise of many within our own government, the Iranian delegation has wholeheartedly refused our plans to aid the development of each other's economies. Their refusal has stemmed from their own belief that our government, due to its supposedly radical nature, is incapable of representing the Middle East in any form of agreement be it economic or militarily. Whilst accepting that the threat of imperialism from the global powers is rising, the Iranians believe that if the Middle East is to stand together it must not follow the doctrine of our own government which has “harmed thousands and continues to neglect the needs of its people.” This rejection has not only harmed unity amongst the Shia nations but also our economy with this rejection already being felt amongst the civilian sector as construction on new factories has now been halted due to the Iranian refusal."

Whilst our Shia population is not a clear majority in our country, the Lebanese people have resonated well with the Houthis' policies believing in their goals of defending the Middle East from imperialist aggression from the Warsaw Pact and Democratic League. The diplomats that have arrived have very simply asked our nation to accept the beginning of new relations with both our countries establishing embassies in each other's nations.

However, with the acceptance by their government, the Shia states of the Middle East have now grown closer together towards a new era of cooperation, one that had been previously unseen in recent history. All that remains now for the President is to continue to rally the Shia states to his side either rallying them to unite under an alliance or to ensure economic independence and prosperity through the establishment of a trading bloc.

In a direct defiance to our aims to establish cooperation amongst the Shia states, the Lebanese government has now refused to discuss the matters further and believe that the best course of action for our two nations is to continue the status-quo and not disturb the balance across the Middle East. Whilst furious that the Lebanese government did not agree to establish new diplomatic relations, the President has understood this decision claiming that the minority has been outspoken by its tyrannical majority a claim that the Lebanese government wholeheartedly denies.

Those opposed to this pact believe that it would directly invite hostilities with the major powers of the world, some of which we have favourable trade deals with, due to the Houthis direct opposition to their hegemony. Joining such an alliance would demonstrate to the world that we stand with the Houthi government, which has largely been denounced as a terrorist organization by many, cutting off all relations with the western world.

This failure also allows us to continue to exercise full sovereignty over our economic matters, as we would otherwise have to negotiate most economic changes with [From.GetName].

To solidify this promise of peace, both leaders signed a non-aggression pact, and were photographed smiling while shaking hands. Some within our government have denounced this peace with the communists, having hoped to unite all of Yemen with our pious hands, but the news has brought joy to many civilians in both Yemeni states, as they celebrate freedom from the horrors of war that had seemed so inevitable so recently.

International observers decried the proceedings as a showtrial, with many of the accused having no lawyers or chance for defending themselves before their verdict was read out. Top-military staff were pleased with the death penalty being given to a majority of the major Nasserite militia leaders for their role in the death of hundreds of good Yemeni soldiers, and Ahmed Saleh himself reportedly gave a toast to his close confidants in the Presidential Palace when the leader of the NUPO, Abdulmalik Al-Mekhlafi, was sentenced to life-long imprisonment for his crimes against the Yemeni people."

At around 2:30 in the morning, soldiers broke down the gate into the complex, and quickly made their way towards the house, and then to the bedroom. Luckily, no one else was in the home at the time, making al-Houthi the only target. 4 minutes after the raid had begun, Hussein al-Houthi was awoken from his bed, and then taken outside, where he was faced against the wall, and shot dead by an improvised firing squad of SSF troopers. Reportedly, Saleh was awake at the time, keeping in touch with developments over radio communications, and congratulated his men on the killing of Al-Houthi. Today, in an address to the nation, Saleh has boldly stated that the Houthis were “the greatest threat to the continuing stability of Yemen” and that last night's developments have been a major setback to the now leaderless terrorist group, and a major victory to a stronger Yemen."

 YAR.59.d:0 "Today, during another sitting of parliament, president Ahmed Saleh has unveiled his intention for Yemen to have its very own military-industrial complex, capable of supplying the Yemeni Armed Forces with basic supplies such as guns, support equipment, and artillery; with the express intent of being able to sell Yemeni made weaponry after 5 years of development across the Middle East and beyond. Large construction projects for factories and research facilities housing the best engineers and testing grounds will be built, and to this end, the proposed “New Economic Plan” will shift an approximate 7% of the yearly Yemeni GDP into military expenditures in order to finance these projects. The plan has garnered a great deal of criticism from national and international economists, with many worrying that this will divert funds away from reconstruction efforts and critical public infrastructure works in the still impoverished nation, such as healthcare and education. However, the GPC government has pushed through, military officials being reportedly ecstatic at the prospects of these so-called ‘reckless expenditures’, while many ordinary citizens simply hope their hard-earned tax dollars don't just go straight to the pockets of corrupt kleptocrats."

In actuality, Al-Waleed had gotten an invitation from president Saleh himself to “help restore Yemeni-Saudi relations and discuss future business opportunities''. After being toured across the island nature reserve and getting to enjoy the lovely white sandy beaches and azure sea, the two men held a lavish dinner at Saleh’s island resort where expensive Andalusian ‘manzanilla’ wine flowed freely and beautiful exotic dancers entertained the two men. By the next morning, the very groggy and hungover prince was awoken by a very smug looking Ahmed Saleh, who showed Al-Waleed an apparent recording of him snorting cocaine from the belly of a scantily clad woman with others dancing around them. Saleh then remarked he would keep the tape a secret in return for some very lucrative deals and shares in Waleed’s Kingdom Holding Company. Some time later, Waleed was seen angrily boarding his flight back to Riyadh earlier than planned, while the president personally came to wave the plane off, grinning as he did so."

Thanks to his efforts, Yemen has been transformed into one of the world's major exporters of rare and precious metals. Despite this, it is the duty of the government to ensure his people’s prosperity, to which Saleh announced the creation of a state owned company called “the Yemen Mining Corporation” or YeMiCo, giving the Yemeni state a minimum 75% share in all produce and profits in every precious metal mine on Yemeni soil. While heralded by the government with great fanfare, lead national and international mining executives are less enthused with this sudden nationalisation, some even calling it a simple robbery by a government of kleptocrats and sycophants, in particular because YeMiCo is owned entirely by Saleh’s family members and the president himself."

And now today, in the capital city of Sana’a and surrounded by a crowd of his most ardent supporters, president Ahmed Saleh stood before a great veiled object in the centre of Tahrir Square. As the Yemeni anthem blared out all across the plaza, Saleh pulled a cord and let the veil slip off, revealing two giant 5 meter golden statues of him and his late father, Abdullah Saleh, atop a shared pedestal, smiling and waving triumphantly towards the horizon. Exclaiming his desire to honour “the Father of Yemen”, who had been cowardly assassinated and died in his very own arms, Ahmed Saleh commissioned the finest goldsmiths who used on the best Yemeni gold ore for this grandiose monument, so that Yemen shall forever be looked after and guided by their gracious and eternal leaders."

There he stood before a veritable crowded sea of heads, both ardent supporters and those politely asked by the policemen in the back to join for the great anniversary celebration of Ahmed Saleh’s victory and vanquishing of his enemies. Saleh spoke for hours, his words strengthening akin to a crescendo. He mocked those filthy communists, liberals and islamists he vanquished, having dared to oppose the rightful heir to the presidency. He denounced the traitorous Houthis and Nasserists, purged for their schemes and plots. He praised his government for having brought wealth and prosperity to the coffers of Yemen. And jubilantly, he exalted himself, for Saleh is the rightful and most magnanimous ruler of the nation, forever guiding it to the will of the Supreme Leader. And as the people clapped and cheered, they wondered for all the good their great and mighty supreme leader had done, if they would ever see it for themselves."

The project has taken many years to complete, following the invitation of highly expensive and skilled nuclear physicists, technicians and construction crews to build and complete Yemen’s first ever nuclear power plant. Officially, the plant will provide much needed electricity to the millions of citizens living in the Azal region, providing a stable electric output in comparison to the frequent failures of dilapidated gas and coal plants. However, unbeknownst to the public and the concerned international community, the reactor will also be the centrepiece of the development and production of Yemen’s first ever nuclear arsenal, ensuring Yemen’s importance on the geopolitical playingfield and discouraging its enemies from aggression. While Saleh gleefully overlooked the turbines and apparatus, of note was the incident during the showcasing of the proposed design for the nuclear warhead, during which an argument broke out between Saleh and the head of the project over the apparent aerodynamics of the missile. However overall, the president was highly pleased with the team’s accomplishments so far and encouraged their continued good work. "

It is well within the realm of possibilities that the Saudis, understanding the might of Yemen’s great army, may be willing to surrender one or two of these territories to us, but demanding the return of all of our historic lands will almost certainly necessitate war. Armed conflict is always a gamble, especially with Saudi Arabia given its vast deserts and the significant distance to its capital, and even if we are on the winning side the cost will likely be great, making more restrained demands potentially a more pragmatic option. Of course, to abandon our ambitions of retaking even an inch of our historic lands would be an insult to the memory of our ancestors and reveal the President to not be a man of his word."

However, the fact of the matter is that the Yemeni military under Saleh’s rule has dramatically expanded and advanced, becoming a true force to be reckoned with, one that our own military officials fear we can’t truly hold a candle to. Furthermore, there’s no telling the carnage that will ensue if we refuse Saleh’s demands, the lives that will be lost.

Now with our reclamation of this lost land, the army has been dispatched to maintain order in the region and begin the suppression of any remaining Omani loyalists who seek to rejoin their former masters.

However, international and some domestic critics of the President's government have both noted that this move towards pluralism leaves out one noteworthy group; Yemen’s Jewish population. The Jews of Yemen have long been a small marginalized community, and the continuation of this trend seems to be yet another front where the Houthis and Nasserists have discovered common ground.

Indeed, this only came after a meeting between the President and a small but influential group of activists and reformers, led by the pro-democratic journalist and feminist Tawakkol Karman. Within this meeting, the President considered the requests and the arguments in favor of progressive reforms from various perspectives, and ended the meeting by assuring that he would do whatever it took for Yemen to stay on the right side of history. With this announcement, it seems that he intends to do what he promised. The announcement has gained widespread approval from progressives from inside the country and out, but could face difficulty moving forwards in the legislature as the Houthi component of the coalition has vowed to oppose it."

 YAR.85.d:0 "President Mekhalfi has today met with union leaders from various sectors of the economy ranging from the electronics industries to waste collection. With unions having been largely suppressed under the Al-Islah regime, the President has wasted no time in repealing the oppressive legislation that held the workers of Yemen back. Initial negotiations saw both the President and union leaders pledge to end the divisiveness amongst the Yemeni working class caused by the Al-Islah government, re-establishing the battered working class. Soon after, acting on this pledge, the President signed legislation granting workers across Yemen significant concessions ranging from increased pay, shortened working hours and granting nominated union leaders positions in government. With these concessions the President has hoped that this will dampen the necessity for future strike action, as workers now have direct access to the President through their appointed representatives in government who have been granted an equal voice to elected officials within parliament. Now, with negotiations coming to an end, workers across the nation have celebrated a new beginning for the working class and, at last, the end of Al-Islah’s policies."

The speech began by Mekhlafi recounting another meeting he had with youth before the war, where they stated their dissatisfaction with the Yemeni education system before the civil war which had lacked reasonable funding and rejected those from poorer backgrounds. Now in an effort to rectify these comments made by the students at the time the President announced during his speech at Sana’a University that, with the establishment of the new Nasserist government, the education system would finally be brought into the modern era with all being allowed to attend the various universities across the nation and funding being granted to all schools and universities who required it. Concluding his speech the President remained hopeful that in time, as the funding is granted and properly allocated to the correct areas by universities and schools, the young Yemenis who have struggled for years will at last be given the education they are entitled to."

Having been in construction since 2008, having struggled to find workers to aid in construction and lacking in adequate funding for the project, the power plant has now been activated lighting up Sana’a in a manner previously unseen. With the powerplant having been generating power for Sana’a throughout the day, President Mekhlafi arrived at the station late into the evening to give a speech congratulating the efforts of the workers who had aided in construction as well as pledging to continue the modernization efforts so that Yemen can at last look to the future united under a new society. Having completed his speech the nation has committed itself to the rejuvenated effort at ensuring the modernization of the Yemeni economy, with funding being granted for the construction of further power plants and factories across the nation in an effort that will ensure an improved quality of life for all Yemeni citizens. With this construction now an ongoing process the people have become aware that, unlike the Al-Islah government, the NUPO is committed to the advancement of Yemeni society and its economy."

With the existence of these domestic terrorists it has become evident that, in order to ensure a safe and secure society, the Yemeni Intelligence Agency must be reformed and expanded. Funding has already been given Presidential approval with this money already being allocated to the various departments that will safeguard the nation from threats both domestic and foreign. In addition to monitoring the orthodox Marxists, Salafists and Saleh loyalists, the intelligence agency has also been tasked with ensuring the protection of the nation from nearby threats, such as Saudi Arabia, and the world powers who may seek to abuse Yemen’s strategically important location near the Red Sea. With the agency now monitoring all of Yemen, in time there will be none left internally to amass the support to overthrow our government nor will our external foes be able to gain an upper hand against us."

With the establishment of these national parks the tourism sector has seen a drastic increase in income with the Yemeni middle-class contributing mostly to this improvement, with a small minority of the income coming from foreign visitors. Whilst much of the population has supported this move, including our partners in the Houthi movement, there are some who have opposed this move by the government. Industrialists from across the nation have criticised our decision to establish these parks, claiming that the preservation of these lands holds back the expansion of existing industries nearby and will slow down the modernization efforts that were promised by the President. Whilst aware of the economic implications of the establishment of these parks, the President has remained committed to this policy denouncing the industrialists as nothing more than profit seeking capitalists, stating that the protection of the environment is a necessity in achieving modernization."

Throughout his speech the President made several comparisons to pre civil-war society and life now, highlighting the fact that healthcare and education are now rights of the masses rather than a privilege of the few. Furthermore, unionization has become the standard in the workplace with the workers granted the right to determine their own fate, rather than be subject to the whims of a dictatorial capitalist. Where there once stood a collection of crumbling, archaic, underfunded institutions, there now stands state-of-the-art services prepared to serve the Yemeni people and propel the nation towards greatness. There is no denying that, for the average Yemeni citizen, life is much better today than it was a few short years ago, and, during the closing moments of his speech, Mekhlafi declared that “all of this is owed not to me, but to you, my friends, my comrades, my people, you who have given this republic its righteous mandate, you who have recognized the vision of what we could be, and you who made it so.”"

The representatives, all associates of Yemeni President Saleh, took our diplomats on quite the evening out to grease their palms ahead of negotiations. The result was a night of frivolous expenditure and debauchery the likes of which have not been seen since the days of the American corporate lobbyists and billionaires that used to spend so much time with Canadian officials. It’s practically a miracle that no scandal or incriminating photos emerged from the lavish ordeal! The Yemeni representatives made it clear that this sort of treatment is the new standard of cordiality for us should we decide to grant their request for advisors. However, as much as our officials were enamoured by the luxurious generosity of the Yemeni delegation, there are other factors to consider. While the new Yemeni government is decidedly pro-western, and thus a potential ally, it is also worth noting the potential diplomatic incident that could result from drawing too close to them. After all, Saleh is known to have purged many of his political rivals in a decidedly undemocratic fashion, and so an alliance with him may not be the best look for a supposed bastion of democracy like us."

With the ambassadors having now returned, a few million rial richer, the mining corporation representatives were pleased to announce that aid will be sent our way and that the Canadian government was happy to share any technology that would aid in the development of our mining industries. These advisors are some of the most well respected and prolific professionals in their field, and have brought overwhelming success to countless Canadian mining ventures. With the help of their guidance and tutelage, it can be guaranteed that our country’s mineral extraction industries will reach heights never seen by past administrations, providing us with a welcome source of income and more resources to fuel our growing industry."

Having cited our conduct as “juvenile” and the “corrupt” status of our democratic institutions as “problematic”. This grave insult will not be forgotten, and it is unlikely that we will have any kind of relationship with Canada in the foreseeable future.

Our officials were apprehensive at first - Muslims aren’t a group that most in the American Republic hold in especially high esteem - but quickly began to warm up to the Yemeni delegation. For a group of people who follow a religion that forbids alcohol, the Yemenis certainly seemed to handle their liquor well during the many whiskey fuelled “negotiations” that they invited our representatives to. By the end of their stay in Atlanta, Saleh’s representatives had thoroughly explored every high-end bar and gentlemen's club in the city and brought our officials along for an all-expenses-paid ride. They have certainly left an impression on our government, and we must now decide whether or not to sell weapons to them. Of course, such a venture is guaranteed to be profitable, and their nationalistic and pro-Western politics have much in common with our own system. However, Arabs remain a group with little trust among the average American, and so establishing relations with Arab nationalists might raise some eyebrows. Plus, we may need all the weapons we have for any conflicts that may be coming in the near future."

Not as though money was ever an object for us, but the relative affordability is a nice bonus. The fact of the matter is that our industry is not yet ready to fulfil the demands of our military ambitions, with both the quality and quantity of our armaments being well below what a reliable, professional military requires. While that situation is on track to rectify itself in the near future, this weapons deal will provide us with the large amount of high quality guns we need to fuel our current military expansion. The sooner we have our armies armed and ready, the sooner we will be able to pursue our ambitions in the region, and the more likely the other powers of the world are to begin taking us seriously. Weapon shipments should begin any day now, and they are expected to almost immediately find their way into the hands of our soldiers."

Whilst we have replaced Al-Islah as the legitimate government, establishing an entirely new state in its place, many had believed that our interests had aligned with the Americans and that they would willingly forget any differences that existed between us, however, this was not the case. Whilst frustrating and insulting, this is not too major a setback with our industries already beginning preparations to produce more weaponry for the upcoming struggle in the Middle East.

It’s unlikely our representatives had ever consumed such quantities of alcohol and illicit drugs as they did during the process of “negotiations” with the Yemenis. However, it appears that not everyone got along as well as planned during these proceedings, with a drunken fist fight having broken out between the Russian and Yemeni representatives. In a case of rather atrocious luck on our part, the Yemenis managed to walk away with a photograph depicting one of our delegates on top of one of theirs, very clearly and plainly showing him in the process of pummeling the Arab man. It’s implied this photo may find its way to the public if the Yemeni deal isn’t accepted. It's doubtful that the leaking of this photograph would have any kind of lasting adverse affect on our diplomatic reputation, but it would certainly be humiliating for those involved. The deal isn’t bad; by accepting it we could dodge some embarrassment and make some money, but many in our government would rather keep the oil and cut all ties with Yemen on principle."

Luckily, we managed to catch one of the Russian delegates in a compromising position during the proceedings, in a drunken brawl with one of our own ambassadors, giving us just the leverage we needed to convince them to see our point of view. Whilst it is still uncertain as to who started the brawl, the Russians believe that such an image will compromise their position on the world stage demonstrating them to be nothing more than drunken madmen. As much as they may have resented our methods, it's not as though it’s a new method in the world of Russian politics, and it’s worked to stunning success. The Russians have now provided us with substantial oil reserves, albeit for a slightly higher price than we’d intended on paying, on the promise that we hand over the original copy of the photograph to them and destroy any copies- which we have naturally complied with, to an extent. Now with this agreement settled, the oil from Russia will begin fueling our inevitable war effort."

However, today they have now responded to our supposed attempted “blackmail” calling our actions reprehensible, believing our representatives to be nothing more than juvenile, treating the world as if it were a playground. As promised should they refuse our offer, this photo has now been released to the international community slightly damaging their reputation. Despite this rejection the President believes that the oil fields of Yemen are more than capable of supplying our nation with all it needs, stating that the negotiations with the Russians were a mere formality in an attempt to establish Yemen in the international community.

It’s unclear how the Yemenis even came into possession with these priceless relics, but, needless to say, our delegation has been incredibly grateful to receive them, whether they returned them to museums or added them to their own personal collections. As much as this move has swayed the hearts of many of our delegation, not everyone is wholly convinced. After all, Yemen is a predominantly Islamic nation, and, given our historic disputes with Pakistan, muslims remain a group of ill repute, even if Saleh and his representatives are a far cry from the image of the pious Arab. Furthermore, from a simple foreign policy stance, it’s possible that giving Yemen access to better electronics now may come back to bite us later, one way or another.

With Indian archeologists having to determine whether these artifacts are real, having now been confirmed as such, these artifacts have now been handed to the proper authorities and placed into a museum for safe keeping. The return of these artifacts has strengthened relations between our two nations, with the President having joked that if the Indian ambassadors expect this to be the norm for our two countries we will have to triple the pay of our nation's archaeologists, or begin creating elaborate and extremely detailed replicas.

To make matters worse, our ambassadors had taken these valuable artifacts with them and had an archeologist inspect them to prove they were not replicates. Whilst a sign of good faith, we had expected this would be enough for the Indian government to agree to our demands and now to avoid angering the Indians further these artifacts have been handed over with our government receiving nothing in return. Such an outcome has been less than favourable as the amount of money spent tracking these valuable artifacts will not be easily replaced, and our electronics industry continues to lack behind the advancement seen across the country.

Whilst President Saleh and President [IRQ.GetLeader] believed that such an alliance would only strengthen the Middle East, allowing nations to assert their independence from the imperialist powers of the Democratic League and Warsaw Pact, concerns have been raised over what other nations in the Middle East would think. The pact would emphasize the self-determination of all Middle Eastern people, however, fears over the alliance removing sovereignty from its member states have been raised by the two President’s.

Of course, joining a faction with Yemen and its allies could also mean being forced to set aside our own ambitions, or, perhaps even worse, open ourselves up to subversive political influence from new allies that we may not ideologically align with. Our officials are fairly torn on the matter, unsure whether or not we should formally ally ourselves to Yemen, though some have proposed a sort of compromise; a simple non-aggression pact.

In response to this, President Saleh has authorized the army to put down all protestors seeking to overthrow our control over Bahrain.

Of course, if we refuse and the Yemenis march on our nation, there’s nothing stopping Yemen from annexing us outright if we lose. Some of our generals believe that we could survive the Yemeni onslaught long enough for them to give up, but others are far more skeptical of our own abilities, and have framed our decision as being between a life of servitude or an honorable death.

Similar to the confederation agreement signed by former King Ahmad bin Yahya in 1958, this observer status grants us access to the economic benefits of being a full member of the republic whilst lacking any political representation within the republic itself. Whilst some have opposed this lack of representation, believing that any deal with the United Arab Republic should include immediate political representation, the President has assured his allies that this representation shall come when the time is right with further negotiations between Yemen and the United Arab Republic already being planned. The acceptance of this deal is a significant step forward for Arab unity, and the goals of the President who has stated he shall not rest until the dreams of both Nasser and Arab unity are realized across all of the Middle East."

Furthermore, as the people begin to become aware of the United Arab Republics rejection, the population has now begun to protest against our government with many rallying to the cause of anti-Nasserist movements as it becomes clearer that the supposed home of the pan-Arab cause has no interest in our nation. With this rift opening between the people and the government, the President will have to find alternative means of reassuring the people that the cause of Nasserism is worth fighting for and that Arab unity is an achievable goal within his lifetime."

In return the Yemenis will be granted further economic aid to go towards the construction of their own infrastructure improving not only their industries but the lives of their people. While it seems as though the plan could easily pay for itself in the long run, the Yemeni government has insisted on investment from us to ensure the project begins as soon as possible. This demand has turned off some of our cabinet ministers, with some believing the Yemeni government is making too many demands for such a new member of our union.

It has now become clear to both the President and the people that whilst the United Arab Republic is fully prepared to add our land, population, and resources to their sphere of influence, their officials are not particularly interested in investing into our nation.

If this investment proves successful, economists have estimated a substantial improvement in the Yemeni economy vastly improving their output of civilian goods. However, economists have also noted that the payment would put a significant dent in our own treasury leading to some of our officials questioning whether the short term cost is worth the long term payoff.

By the end of these investors time in Yemen not only will we be five-hundred million rial richer, as the agreement stipulated, but the people of Yemen will at last be given access to much needed goods at a quicker pace than before increasing the people's favour of our government and advancing our nation towards a new future.

Many had hoped that with our admission into the United Arab Republic as an observer state, that their government would be more than willing to aid in the development of our economy. However, it has become clear that our worth to the Arab Republic is less than we had previously imagined.

Largely, this request is but a formality, given that previous agreements between Yemen and the United Arab Republic have already brought our two countries so close together that they are practically already one, meaning that a denial of admission would be an incredibly foolish move on all fronts. Nevertheless, we do still have the final say in the matter, and technically can reject Yemen’s entrance into the United Arab Republic if we so choose.

Having been told to try once more in the coming years, our population has now turned to the streets to protest this rejection. With public support in our government taking a significant hit thanks to this rejection, with anti-Nasserist rallies being held across the country, many have begun to wonder just what the point of working with the United Arab Republic was if they would not accept our integration when we believed ourselves ready.

Soon after the various leaders in turn thanked the President for his own hard work, specifically the removal of President Saleh from his position. As the day progressed the President agreed to aid the various socialist parties in their attempts to overthrow their own despotic leaders, but was forced to admit that the Yemeni government could only offer financial aid for those in attendance to ensure the increase of their activities in their respective countries. Furthermore, the President also offered individual advice to each party for their own country recognising the vast differences in the political structures of Iraq compared to Oman.

This turn of event has led to shock and outrage for many Arab pan-nationalists, who had hoped that we would seek to unify Arabia under Nasserism. According to Mekhlafi, the cost would be too high to be morally justifiable, as many Yemenis would assuredly perish in the ensuing violence, and the chaos of war could lead to unexpected outcomes in our region.

This move has been widely celebrated in the halls of power, as it has established a positive relationship between us and one of the most successful and respected bastions of revolutionary ideology in the world.

 YAR.172.t:0 "Government Consolidates Control"
 YAR.172.d:0 "Houthi militias, backed by their Republican Guard and pro-government allies, have broken the brewing revolution in the streets of Sana'a. According to a report released by the Ansar Allah movement’s media department, thousands of “socialist terrorists” have been arrested by Houthi fighters sent to quell chaos in the country’s capital. Now, the chaos has mostly subsided, but President Saleh has raised concerns with his claims that the country “must be stabilized completely” before the government could go through with the reforms ostentatiously granted to the Houthis, with some suspecting that Saleh is actually plotting to cut off the Houthis once and for all to cement his rule on the country. Whatever the case, it will only be a matter of days now before the final nail is put in the coffin of Saleh’s enemies, or less likely, the rule of his own government."

 YAR.173.d:0 "In scenes reminiscent of the protests that sparked the civil war mere months ago, a sea of people crowd through the main streets and plazas of the capital city. International and state media roll their cameras as protestors chant and shout in defiance of president Saleh. Red banners mingle with those blue and those adorned with Jasmines, as Nasserites and Houthis are joined by those having supported both Islah and the Jasmines in a shared message of public discontent against the sitting government. President Saleh has been in his Presidential Palace for days now, giving speeches to rouse his countrymen and accuse foreign powers ranging from the likes of Canada and Saudi Arabia to Iran for bankrolling and backing the “insurrectionists”. Yet now only a contingent of government security forces are all that stands in between the Presidential Palace and the heated masses. Guns drawn and soldiers anxious as the protestors reached the perimeter, the commander stares out at his fellow Yemenis shouting and waving their banners, among them a lone girl with fierce blue eyes holding a Jasmine flower in her hands, as Saleh gives the order to fire."

 YAR.174.t:0 "GPC Leaders Arrested"
 YAR.174.d:0 "At the dawn of the agreed upon date, Republican Guard and police security forces began to set in motion a plan drawn up by president Saleh to finally rid Yemen of the “cancer that is the Houthis”. What they did not expect was the fully organised counteroffensive, the Houthis seemingly aware of everything. As government forces are caught completely off-guard, large portions of the nation are brought under Houthi control. Fighting in Sana’a is fierce, yet after a prolonged siege, both parliament and the GPC headquarters are taken over, with many prominent GPC leaders having been arrested. Meanwhile, Houthi leader Abdel Malik Al-Houthi narrowly escapes a planned drone attack, having remained at the planned location of his death until the final moments to elude the intelligence forces. President Saleh himself was later reported to be arrested just outside Sana’a in a school gymnasium, having been split off from his security detachment as he attempted to flee the city. With the swift and sudden victory of their forces, the Houthis now find themselves as sole custodians of Yemen, and it is to be seen what Al-Houthi shall decide to do next."

 YAR.175.d:0 "This morning, Canadian officials announced that Canada has accepted our petition to join the Democratic League. In an effort to impress Canada and encourage them to allow us into their faction, we recently invited a delegation from their country to Yemen, which we then took on a tour of the country and treated to only the most exquisite accommodations. Clearly, our efforts to impress the Canadians have paid off beautifully, with their decision to allow us into the Democratic League passing with very little deliberation. This is a momentous day for Greater Yemen, at long last recognized as a worthy ally by one of the major powers of the world. The official party line is that together we shall defend democracy throughout the world, and offer a check against the evils of communism. Of course, the real reason for our initial interest is that Canada seems more likely to be on the winning side of whatever conflicts are around the corner, and it’s always profitable to have an ally who is highly dependent on our oil production."

In an effort to impress Canada and encourage them to allow us into their faction, we recently invited a delegation from their country to Yemen, which we then took on a tour of the country and treated to only the most exquisite accommodations. However, despite all of this fanfare, it seems that the ungrateful heathens have still denied our request to join their faction, having stated that the Democratic League remains an exclusive pact for all allies of democracy. Whilst our delegates had aimed to persuade the League’s delegates, by insisting we are an ally of democracy, their ambassadors have rejected this claim stating that the control the General People’s Congress holds over our country is paramount to a dictatorship. Furthermore, the Canadian ambassadors have now branded us as an authoritarian regime significantly impacting our relations with other states across the world. This grievous insult has left our nation isolated from one of the greatest powers in this world and their valuable allies, with no connection to the outside world the President will now have to find new ways to profit off of the upcoming conflicts in the world."

After all the fanfare, negotiations began, and it seems that our efforts to impress the Russians have paid off beautifully, with their delegates having now accepted our entry into the Moscow Accords. The acceptance of our request is a momentous occasion for the people of Greater Yemen as, at long last, we have found ourselves recognized as a worthy ally to one of the major powers of the world. With plans for Russian ambassadors and military advisors to be sent to our nation to secure the alliance and to further improve our army, the globe now watches on as the once rump state of the Middle East and Russia have found common interests, the defeat of the evils of communism and the solidification of ourselves as the sole powers in our regions."

However, despite all of this fanfare, it seems that the ungrateful heathens have still denied our request to join their faction, saying that, despite our considerable wealth and military, President Saleh is too much of a loose cannon, one that may drag Russia into an unnecessary war. Despite having explained that the interests of President Saleh in the Middle East had now been completed following the establishment of Greater Yemen, the Russians refused to hear our ambassadors further believing that President Saleh would not be satisfied until the entire Middle East lay subjugated under him. This response has confused many within the cabinet, as many had previously believed that our ambitions and Russias had aligned with both of our nations seeking to become the sole powers in our respective regions. Regardless, the Russians response has revealed the shortcomings of their government with many believing that in time they will come crawling back to us in desperation."

 YAR.179.d:0 "Shock, anger, panic. The reaction of the international community, especially our neighbours, was to be expected with the completion of the first successful nuclear test of Yemen. Detonated near the border of Saudi Arabia in the edge of the Rub al-Khali, or “Empty Quarter”, the reaction of our neighbours has been swift as they demanded an explanation. Just a few hours later, the Glorious Supreme and Eternal Leader of the Yemen Arab Republic, president Ahmed Saleh, sent out a recording of him in his Presidential Palace, with an even wider grin on his face than many had previously thought possible, to all international news stations and sites. Excitedly, he exclaimed that: “No longer shall Yemen be the backwater and playground of international politics and scheming. We ourselves are the masters of our glorious destiny. You can either be our friends, and we shall love and entertain you, or you can be our enemies, and you shall feel our wrath!” Saleh then continued by promoting his newly built luxury resort on the island of Socotra to be open for tourists, at which point the recording ends. While the Democratic League, Warsaw Pact and Saudi Arabia denounce our glorious test, many international leaders are simply perplexed, wondering just what the “Mad Dictator” will do next."

Some time later, a recording of the self proclaimed ‘Glorious Supreme and Eternal Leader of the Yemen Arab Republic’, President Ahmed Saleh, was released towards all international news stations and sites. In the recording, he excitedly exclaimed that Yemen had successfully tested its first nuclear warhead and stated that: “No longer shall Yemen be the backwater and playground of international politics and scheming. We ourselves are the masters of our glorious destiny. You can either be our friends, and we shall love and entertain you, or you can be our enemies, and you shall feel our wrath!” Immediately, international denunciations have been fierce, especially from Yemen’s neighbours. Saudi Arabia has already closed its borders, with member states of the Democratic League and Warsaw Pact preparing for possible sanctions, while many international leaders are simply perplexed, wondering just what the “Mad Dictator” will do next."

AHMED_SALEH_DESC: "Viewed by many across Yemen as the rightful successor to his father, the current leader of the General People’s Congress and head of the Republican Guard, Ahmed Saleh, has spent the last two decades fighting for a resurgence of Yemeni glory under his fathers name. Having been denied the opportunity to lead the nation on account of his age following his fathers death in 1994, the young brigadier general soon saw himself on the front lines throughout the civil war, leading several tank divisions during the recapture of Al Hudaydah port in 1996 and paving the way for the eventual capture of Aden in 2003. By 2005, Saleh’s position as leader of the General People’s Congress was finally realized following the signature of the Legacy Agreement allowing for the return of the Saleh name to Yemeni politics once more. Whilst unsuccessful to restore his fathers legacy in the 2005 election, Saleh and the GPC have remained a constant thorn in the side of the Yemeni government since then routinely causing disruptions in parliamentary session and purposefully allying with independents in an effort to shut down bills. Having never attended parliament himself, despite being an elected member, Saleh himself has spent much of his time since the 2005 general election strengthening his Republican Guard and, in more recent times, allying with movements across the nation to bring about the final end of the Al-Islah government. Should Saleh succeed in his endeavors, Yemen will, at last, become his playground and the Saleh legacy shall be secured."
