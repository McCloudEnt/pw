 neonazi_desc:0 "Seeking to revive the ideology of the historical Nazi Party, Neo-Nazis are seen as the farthest of the political fringe, and aim for a society based on scientific racism and anti-semitism complete with a racial hierarchy to promote racial purity. Although classical Neo-Nazis believe in the superiority of the Nordic race, newer Neo-Nazis have instead moved closer towards white supremacy in general in an effort to expand their base of support."

 falangist_desc:0 "Falangism exhalts Catholicism as a religious identity, believing that society can only properly function if there is total authority, hierarchy, and order. Although classified as far-right, Falangism holds aspects of anti-capitalism alongside anti-communism, anti-liberalism, and anti-democratic thought."

 klanist_desc:0 "The ideology of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in the 21st Century can be described as a fusion of white supremacy, neo-Confederate beliefs, neo-Nazism, and Christian Identity. Although the KKK was long thought to have been lost to time ever since the Civil Rights Movement, the rise in popularity of David Duke and his rejection of the iconic robes has made it easier for members to openly and proudly identify themselves as KKK members. However, it remains to be seen if the KKK can win back the South."

 shiv_sena_desc:0 "Thackerism, or Shiva Sena, is an extreme form of Hindutva that makes most other forms of religious fundamentalism in India seem moderate in comparison. Despite this, it has found an alliance in the Indian People's Party, the political wing of the RSS. However, Marathi ethnic interests remain a central tenet in the ideology of Shiv Sena."
