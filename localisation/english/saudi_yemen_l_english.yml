#Saudi Yemen events
saudi_yemen.1.t: "Yemen Requests Military Intervention"
saudi_yemen.1.d: "Ambassadors from occupied north Yemen have today arrived in Riyadh, requesting our intervention into the ongoing political crisis within the region. The ambassadors have stated that given the increase in terrorist activity, the potential for the new Yemeni government to be overthrown has unfortunately increased tenfold and that the stability of Yemen must be prioritized, else the consequences may soon affect Riyadh. As such, the meetings proceeded with the Yemeni ambassadors requesting a shipment of armaments to be used to equip their armed forces. While many have seen the necessity of this shipment, others continue to downplay the crisis in Yemen, believing that it will dissipate within the coming weeks. Furthermore, others have noted that if our weapons were to find their way into the hands of the Yemeni government, it would only further legitimize the ongoing protests claiming the current government to be a puppet. With the debate ongoing, our government must now determine whether or not the Yemeni government will be able to handle the existing resistance alone or help increase their military capabilities, at the risk of the crisis developing further."
saudi_yemen.1.a: "If we are to retain Yemen it must remain stable"
saudi_yemen.1.b: "It is none of our concern"
saudi_yemen.2.t: "Saudi Arabia Agrees to Intervene"
saudi_yemen.2.d: "Our ambassadors have today returned from Riyadh with the news that our allies have now agreed to send the weapons we requested. With this, our military will be more than capable of dealing with the ongoing protests. Although many within the Saudi government were initially sceptical of this deal, believing it would legitimize the protests against our government, initial reports have revealed no further increase in activity by the opposition. The arrival of this equipment has now been heralded by the government as the deepening of ties between our two nations, with the army eager to prove their worth and convince the Saudi government of our military might. Furthermore, President Ahwal has also extended his thanks to the Saudi government, stating that the newfound alliance between our states is developing satisfactorily. Despite these positive signs, some have begun to raise concerns over how far the influence of the Saudi royalty goes within Yemeni politics, particularly within high command. For the time being our army has now been rejuvenated and in time stability shall, hopefully, return to our nation thanks to the generosity of the Saudi government."
saudi_yemen.2.a: "We give thanks to our friends in Riyadh"
saudi_yemen.3.t: "Saudi Arabia Refuses to Intervene"
saudi_yemen.3.d: "Despite our requests to the Saudi government, our allies in Riyadh have refused send weapons to our courageous soldiers. The lack of this equipment has soured relations between President Ahwal and the Saudi government, with the President having believed that Saudi-Yemeni relations had recently reached new heights given the recent military intervention by Saudi Arabia. Having explained that their involvement in our politics would only further legitimize the protests against our government, and risk the collapse of our government, relations between President Ahwal and [SAU.GetLeader] have been salvaged and the President has begrudgingly accepted the Saudi explanation. Whilst relations have been salvaged, the economy has now been dealt a significant blow by leading terrorist cells after the financial district of Sana'a was targetted by an attack. Making this worse, experts estimate could most likely have been avoided if the Saudi government had not withheld the requested equipment. Disgruntled army officials have now requested a meeting with the President to discuss the Saudis lack of help for our government, however, these voices will likely fall on deaf ears."
saudi_yemen.3.a: "An unfortunate economic and political setback"
saudi_yemen.4.t: "Trial of the Republican Guard"
saudi_yemen.4.d: "Members of Ahmed Saleh's elite Republican Guard have today been placed on trial for crimes against the Yemeni people, both during and before the outbreak of the civil war. Although Saleh himself is unable to face justice, having been found dead in a collapsed makeshift command center on the outskirts of Rada'a, other senior figures such as Tareq Saleh were possible to bring forward to face justice. Overseeing the court proceedings were several officials with ties to the Saudi government, who despite pledges of neutrality were spotted communicating with the judge several times throughout the hearing. Although a guilty verdict is inevitable, there have been growing calls from within the Yemeni armed forces to allow for the reintegration of the Republican Guard into armed forces to bolster them and bring them into the modern era. Such a decision by the court would no doubt anger the Saudi government, who have made their position clear: All Republican Guard members are to be stripped of their ranks and the Guard itself outlawed. The decision now comes down to the courts, which must decide whether appeasing the Saudi government means more than modernizing the Yemeni military."

saudi_yemen.5.t: "Terrorist Leaders Executed in Marib"
saudi_yemen.5.d: "In a siege akin to the National Democratic Front's rebellion of 1982, members of the armed forces were successful in their attempts at recapturing the valuable industrial town of Marib, restarting oil production in the nearby oil fields. Furthermore, reports have now arrived at the President's desk detailing that the leaders of the so-called United Yemeni Front have been arrested trying to escape across the border to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The capture of the leaders of the terrorist cell has now dealt a significant blow to the rest of the organization, with very little activity being reported across the country, forcing our security advisors to believe the UYF have gone underground for the time being. Having been authorized to execute those captured, a grand triumph was quickly organized and broadcasted to the nation, showing the captured leaders marching down the streets of Marib before being forced to the ground and shot where they stood. Whilst the threat of rebellion is still present, especially amongst the youth and elements of the armed forces, stability has at least somewhat now been restored to our nation."
saudi_yemen.5.a: "Some good news at last"
saudi_yemen.6.t: "Future of the Economy"
saudi_yemen.6.d: "Beginning the conference, the Saudi government has demanded that we produce an in-depth report on the plans for economic development and integration between our two countries. Implicit in this is the wish that we bring our economy in line with the Saudi economic model of mass exports and bolstering our oil production. Nevertheless, our delegates have also drafted a further two documents for the Saudi government detailing alternate proposals. The first of which would be to continue along with the policies of the previous Al-Islah government, working closely with businesses and seeking foreign investment from across the world. Although this plan has its merits, some are critical that it might just mean a return to a policy that has already failed. The second, and more controversial plan, would be to demand that the Saudi government allows economic independence for Yemen and establish what has become known as the New Economic Model. Such a model would reestablish the highly successful Local Development Agencies and nationalize key industries. However, such a plan would go directly against President Ahwals wishes and may spark tensions with the Saudi government."

saudi_yemen.7.t: "Fate of the Armed Forces"
saudi_yemen.7.d: "The other important topic for discussion at the conference with our Saudi allies has been the future of the armed forces. With the trial of the Republican Guard still in fresh memory, the Saudi delegation are keen to determine our plans for the army and whether or whether we intend on retaining ties with our 'liberators'. When pressed to explain how far these ties would go by our delegation, their Saudi counterparts detailed that the army would be guided forward in its modernization by leading generals within the Saudi army, stating that the Yemeni civil war had revealed how poorly our generals can perform in the face of combat. Whilst some delegates were inclined to agree with the statement, some were opposed to the idea believing it would be another step in securing our position as the Saudis lapdog. Instead, other members of the delegation have proposed that the status-quo be upheld and that the army be allowed to continue operating independently of the Saudi military and have pointed to recent successes in Marib as reasons for this. Annoyed, the Saudis have pressured our delegation to see reason demanding that any attempts at modernization without their aid would lead to further disaster. Only time will tell what the Yemeni delegation will respond."

saudi_yemen.8.t: "Delegate Speaks up Against Saudi Occupation"
saudi_yemen.8.d: "On the final day of our delegation's visit to Riyadh, the spark that President Ahwal had hoped to avoid may now have been ignited. Following a terse exchange of words between our delegation and Saudi officials, one delegate was unable to hold his tongue and has now called on the Saudis to depart Yemen and allow its independence to be restored. Having been dressed down and discharged following his remarks, other members of the delegation have now been divided over the matter, with some standing with their fellow Yemeni and others respecting President Ahwals wishes of not upsetting the status quo. With this potentially being the catalyst for further conflict, the President has sent another delegation to Riyadh with instructions to deeply apologize for the incident and state that this delegate does not speak for the Yemeni government or its people. Having now arrived in Riyadh, the delegation has begun its meetings with the representatives of the outraged Saudi government, with the Saudis demanding the delegate handed over regardless of our apologies. Now after hours of discussion the meetings have come to an end, with our delegates making their, and by extension our, position clear."

saudi_yemen.9.t: "Opening of the Riyadh Conference"
saudi_yemen.9.d: "At the behest of the Saudi government, our ambassadors have been called to Riyadh to discuss the ongoing political crisis in our country and to jointly plan the best course of action. With the meeting expected to touch on a range of issues such as the focus of the Yemeni economy and the status of the armed forces, the President is expecting them to act as a mere formality on the road towards a new, and fairer, era of relations between our two governments. This view is however being challenged, as some have expressed their disappointment with the President for not attempting to regain the self-determination of the Yemeni people. Attempting to keep a lid on such sentiments so as to not offend the Saudi government, the President has explicitly denied any delegate the right to suggest increased self-determination for Yemen, believing it would cause nothing but further bloodshed. The president's demands are not exactly popular, but the delegation is there at his mercy and is as such expected to respect his wishes. With all now in attendance in Riyadh, the final fate of Yemen may very well be determined over the coming weeks."
saudi_yemen.9.a: "Let us hope an agreement can be reached"
saudi_yemen.10.t: "The Status Quo Prevails"
saudi_yemen.10.d: "Following the recent conference in Riyadh, President Ahwal has now received word that the delegation have followed his demands of not upsetting the status quo with the Saudi government and, despite some tensions between delegations, the Saudis were pleased with our progress and have endorsed our reform programme. The President has now extended his thanks to the entire delegation for winning the Saudis over and to the Saudi government for taking into account the needs of the Yemeni government and its people. This outcome has been heralded as a success by President Ahwal, though concerns have been raised this has doomed future attempts at establishing an independent Yemen, with worries that Yemen will eventually be subsumed into Saudi Arabia widespread. However, these fears have been rejected by the President who instead believes that a mutual understanding between our government and Riyadh has been established, allowing us to preserve our independence as long as we remain a loyal ally. Although this address has served to array some of those fears, many are still unable to feel confident that the arrangement will truly be as mutually beneficial as promised."

saudi_yemen.12.d: "Today on orders by the Saudi government, President Ahwal has stepped down as the head of government and has made way for the coronation of Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud as the new Prince of Yemen. Following a grand parade in Sana'a, the Prince took up residence in the Dar al-Hajar, former palace of the Yemeni royal family, where he was soon crowned after having recited the pledge of allegiance and consulted with the allegiance council who had journeyed from Riyadh to oversee the coronation. Whilst the Prince has been made the official monarch of the new Saudi Kingdom of Yemen, it is expected that he will retain his title of Prince, so as to not overshadow the kingdom in Riyadh, eschewing old Yemeni title of Emir. Across the country, there was little celebration to be seen, as most Yemeni citizens see the event as the final nail in the coffin for any hopes of self-determination. However, celebrations across Saudi Arabia have now been broadcast on Yemeni television in the hopes of generating some level of support for the new government. Now, Prince Turki begins an arduous process of establishing the support needed for this strange new government of Yemen."

Furthermore, the Prince has also decreed that the Yemeni People's Union, an organization established solely to maintain the illusion of self-determination for the Yemeni government under President Ahwal, is to be outlawed. Its members will now be ordered to either embrace the rule of the Prince or be stripped of their roles, being banned from all political activity if they refuse. While the majority have accepted this proposal, some, mostly those with relations to tribal families, have rejected the proposition seeing, seeing exile as preferable to serving a government inimical to their heritage. Their rejections have only confirmed the suspicions held by our government, and the government is already preparing reforms aimed at freeing Yemen of tribal influence."

Since moving to Sana'a to oversee his fief, the Prince has split his time between the residence in the Dar al-Hajar and the former Presidential Palace for government affairs. Now with the announcement spreading across the nation, many have recoiled in horror at the proposal, as this will destroy of one of Yemen's most important historical buildings. Furthermore, Prince Turki has also announced that in order to ensure the security and continuing stability of the Yemeni state, those with ties to tribes or are suspected former members of the United Yemeni Front are to be relocated to the Sa'ada region. The palace is expected to be completed within two years, and many anticipate its completion, viewing it as the final success for the Prince in making Yemen an extension of his homeland."

saudi_yemen.15.t: "Houthi Leadership Executed"
saudi_yemen.15.d: "With most of the country now pacified and under the control of Prince Turki's government, authorization has now been given to the military to carry out a second Sa'ada offensive to wipe out the remaining Houthi militants once and for all. Thanks to extensive Saudi aerial support, the Prince remains confident of the success of the mission and rejects any claims that the operation shall be a repeat of Al-Islah's failed offensive. With Sa'dah having now been nearly destroyed following days of bombardment, the Prince has given the go ahead for ground operations cleaning the city of any remaining resistance. Already the operation has been proven to be effective, with reports coming from the region that the leader of the Houthi militia, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, has been found dead under the rubble of a hastily constructed shelter. With his passing, it is presumed that the Houthi rebels will attempt to regroup under new leadership. As such, all escape routes have been blocked, giving no escape from the combined might of the Saudi and Yemeni armed forces for the Houthi rebels. After years of conflict, the terrorists have at last been put down and peace has returned to Yemen."

saudi_yemen.16.t: "President Ahwal Declares Martial Law"
saudi_yemen.16.d: "With increased terrorist activity across the nation following the end of the Riyadh Conference, the President and his cabinet have drafted plans to establish martial law across the nation. Effective immediately, police commissioners and leading army officials will be granted the authority to quell the terrorist activity by any means necessary. Alreadym checkpoints have been established across the country with stop and search procedures being introduced in all major towns and cities. Whilst some have called the imposition of martial law a breach of the rights of the Yemeni citizens, law enforcement was swift in dealing with these terrorist sympathisers. The President has assured the nation that martial law shall not last forever, and has encouraged the populace to work with the police and army to aid in the arrest of any known, or suspected, terrorists. It is expected that the imposition of martial law will put significant strain on the United Yemeni Front as the arrests of their allies will isolate them in the field of politics even further, making them all the more dependent on Saudi Arabia."

saudi_yemen.17.t: "Tribal Leaders Arrested"
saudi_yemen.17.d: "In the ongoing effort to silence opposition toward the government, President Ahwal has now authorized the arrest of tribal leaders across Yemen. A controversial decision, even amongst the most loyal of cabinet members, the decision has been justified using evidence from the Saudi General Intelligence Presidency claiming to have found ties beween the tribal leaders and the United Yemeni Front. Following a short offensive against the Hashid and Bakil tribes, both Saqid al-Ahmar and Sinan Abu Lahoum have been arrested for these supposed ties to terrorist cells. Despite both having denied the allegations, stating the Saudi government has fed the government with false information to further divide our nation, their treachery will soon be revealed to all. Our decision to arrest these influential tribal leaders has not gone without backlash, as tribes across the nation attempting to rise up against our government. Littel matter, as a short aerial bombardment campaign against tribal strongholds is all that is needed to bring them back in line. With prominent figures within the United Yemeni Front arrested, and the tribes having now had their weapons seized, the President has proclaimed another victory in reestablishing stability to the nation."
saudi_yemen.17.a: "The tribes will no longer cause us any issues"
saudi_yemen.18.t: "Martial Law Ended Across Yemen"
saudi_yemen.18.d: "As promised by President Ahwal, martial law has now been lifted across Yemen following recommendations that the United Yemeni Front and all other terrorist cells have now been successfully quelled. Having arrested an estimated three hundred suspects over the past few months, mountains of evidence were gathered from members of the UYF willing to cooperate with the police. With aid from civilians loyal to our government and the information gathered from the terrorists themselves, our armed forces were finally able to raid the last strongholds of resistance, ending the threat to our society and government. Now with civil order returning to the streets, and the police decreasing their patrols across major towns and cities, an unprecedented level of stability has come over Yemen. With very few willing to speak out against the government and mass protests no longer present in the streets, President Ahwal has praised the brief period of martial law as a resounding success, ensuring the continued prosperity of the nation and his government. "

saudi_yemen.19.t: "Corporate Officials Invited To Government"
saudi_yemen.19.d: "President Ahwal has today announced a drastic reshuffling of his cabinet following pressure from Saudi advisors to further the current economic reforms. Following negotiations with leading corporations across Yemen, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Economy were subsequently removed. Their replacements, the Chairman of the CAC bank Ibrahim Ahmed Al-Hothi and representative to the Red Sea Ports Corporations Muhammad Abu Bakr Ishaq, have now settled into their new roles within the government, beginning their work to bring economic stability to Yemen. The reshuffle has brought a sense of unease to many within the cabinet, who fear the President has begun the transition towards a corporatocratic state, worrying that in time they too shall be replaced by figures from the private sector. The President has attempted to ease these fears, justifying the removals as a necessary step for the progression of the Yemeni economy, soothing some. Now with the corporations aiding in the recovery, businesses shall at last be prioritized, allowing for unprecedented growth to flourish. "
saudi_yemen.19.a: "Corporations know the economy better than any politician"
saudi_yemen.20.t: "President Ahwal Removed From Office"
saudi_yemen.20.d: "With the end of the Riyadh conference, President Ahwal has now received the news that the delegation to Saudi Arabia has gone rogue and demanded that Saudi forces completely vacate Yemen. The political crisis that the President had hoped to avoid has now come to fruition as, shortly after hearing this news, the President was ousted by a surprisingly sizeable clique of the armed forces who then installed Ahmed Ali al Ashwal as the new President of Yemen. With the former President and his cabinet now arrested and awaiting trial for treason, Yemen is holding its collective breath as it awaits a response from the Saudi government. The silence out of Riyadh has only worried President Ashwal, as preparations are already being made to defend the northern borders in case of a Saudi invasion. With the army mobilising and preparing, the President has now begun the process of signing a declaration of independence, officially severing all ties with the Saudi government. Now President Ashwal, and the nation, await the inevitable response of our former occupiers with bated breath."

saudi_yemen.21.t: "Restoration of the Old Constitution"
saudi_yemen.21.d: "Assembling for the first time since the victory over Saudi Arabia, parliament has now unanimously voted in favour of restoring the original 1970 Yemeni constitution. With all previous articles of the constitution ratified, ranging from the establishment of Sharia law and the prohibition of political parties, many within the old guard have praised the restoration as a return to sensible politics and government stability. President Ashwal has now addressed the nation, promising that with the 1970 Constitution restored, the future of Yemen will at long last be bright and peaceful. Despite its passage though, parliament has made it clear to the president that it nevertheless wishes to amend the constitution, wishes the President best heed if he seeks to preserve this hard won stability. However, many within the cabinet have rejected this idea, believing it may begin anew the political conflicts seen throughout the mid-1970s."

saudi_yemen.22.t: "Yemen Organizes Second National Conciliation Agreement"
saudi_yemen.22.d: "The Yemeni government has today reached out to our government for the first time since the signing of the Treaty of Baqim. While our government had originally intended to reject any notion of diplomacy in retaliation for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Baqim, once their ambassador announced their intentions, the ministry of foreign affairs was quick to reconsider. The Yemeni ambassador proposed the a second National Conciliation Agreement that would once and for all strike peace between our nations and ensure that both of us are committed to the Treaty of Baqim. Reception by the government was lukewarm, as many feel there is very little to discuss with the [YEM.GetName], there are yet potential benefits to this deal, with some believing it would be our only hope of restoring friendly relations with our former ally. Since the signature of the original National Conciliation Agreement in 1966, Yemen has long remained one of our closest allies and although their recent war against us has left a clear scar in our relations, many feel it is necessary for our government to look beyond this conflict and return to an era of pragmatism with the Yemeni government."

saudi_yemen.23.t: "Saudi Arabia Agrees to Attend Conciliation Talks"
saudi_yemen.23.d: "Much to the delight of President Ashwal, the Saudi Arabian government has agreed to attend the National Conciliation Agreement in an effort to restore the relations that had once existed between our nations. Whilst some have claimed the President has bent the knee to the Saudi tyrant and betrayed the ideals he stood by when fighting against the Saudi government, the President has ensured that these claims could not be further from the truth and the only reason for these talks is to secure the future safety of the Yemen Arab Republic from the Saudi Arabians. It is expected that our ambassadors shall begin to discuss the demilitarized borders between our nations, the reestablishment of selected trade deals and the declaration of a non-aggression pact between our two governments. Whilst many are still in disbelief that our former foe would be willing to deal with our government so soon after the end of our war with them, our cabinet has come to believe that the Saudi government is more pragmatic than people had originally believed. Now, as the negotiations begin, the President hopes that any past grievances between our two governments can be resolved at these talks."
saudi_yemen.23.a: "We are glad the Saudi government saw reason"
saudi_yemen.24.t: "Saudi Arabia Declines to Attend Conciliation Talks"
saudi_yemen.24.d: "Despite having given the Saudi Arabian government the opportunity to move past the recent conflict and renew our relations, our ambassadors have today announced that the Saudi government has no intention of attending the National Conciliation Agreement. This decision by the Saudi government has left many within our government fearful of the future between our two nations, fearing a return of hostilities and an eventual second war between our nations. Although the President is convinced that the Saudi government would never consider attempting a second invasion of Yemen, military readiness has still been increased and border patrols have increased. With the Saudis refusing to attend the talks, the entire meeting has now lost its purpose. Proposals have been made hastily reorient the conference, and extend invitations to the tribal authorities across the nation, but the President sees no reason to do so, as the loyalty of the tribes is all but assured. For the foreseeable future, tensions between our government and the Saudi tyrant shall no doubt continue, and if their forces seek to march across our border again we shall stand ready once more. "
saudi_yemen.24.a: "Peace was never an option with the Saudi tyrant it seems"
saudi_yemen.25.t: "President Ashwal Orders Parliamentary Reshuffle"
saudi_yemen.25.d: "On orders of the President, parliament has today been purged of insidious elements within. With this, dysfunction within it has come to an end, fulfilling President Eryani's decades-old vision of a functional legislative body. Having forced the retirement of those loyal to Ahmed Saleh and his father Ali Abdullah Saleh, President Ashwal is hopeful that the factionalism that had begun to entrench itself within politics has been torn out, allowing for the constitution to be upheld as it should. The removal of these Saleh loyal elements have been received warmly, as fears that they would bring back the instability of the 70s were widespread. Now, with parliament reconvening and new representatives taking the place of the old Saleh loyalists, the continued stability of the nation has been all but assured as the leading challenge to the President's continued rule has now been neutralized. Although these loyalists may still exist across the nation, their influence in parliament has been shattered and the outlawed General People's Congress remains unable to rally behind a successor to Ali Abdullah Saleh. It is unlikely they will ever again be able to threaten the nation."

saudi_yemen.26.t: "Military Parade Held In Sana'a"
saudi_yemen.26.d: "Since our successful defense of the country against the Saudi tyrant, public support for our government and armed forces has remained at an all-time high, surpassing even that of former President Eryani and his successors. To capitalize off of this popularity, and demonstrate to the Arab world the might of the Yemen Arab Republic, President Ashwal has called for a grand military parade to be held in Sana'a, where our citizens shall be granted to opportunity to give thanks to the brave soldiers who fought for the future of our nation. Furthermore, the President himself shall be escorted by an armored convoy where he shall be given the chance to meet with his beloved citizens and present soldiers with the Order of Yemen for bravery shown during the war for independence. Beginning the ceremony with a flyby by three fighters, which each dispersed the colors of the national flag, President Ashwal then spoke on the importance of continued unity, stating that although the battle was won, the revolution had to live on in the hearts of every citizen. With all three branches of the armed forces having attended the ceremony the people, and the Arab world, have now borne witness to the revived might of our armed forces and are aware that a new era has now begun in our glorious nation."

saudi_yemen.27.t: "General People's Congress Handed Power"
saudi_yemen.27.d: "After having received a total of eighty-six letters from members of parliament, enough to constitute a majority, President Ashwal has been forced to call a second emergency session of parliament, this time with mandatory attendance. Having begun the session in an address to the house, where he praised their commitment to the revolution against Saudi Arabia and their continued dedication the nation's interests, President Ashwal soon turned to other matters. Officially recognizing that factionalism was brewing within parliament, the President called for the passage of a constitutional amendment that would restore the General People's Congress as the sole political party, promising that if it was passed through the house he would step down. In a shock to the President, the two-thirds majority was easily reached and chants across parliament for his resignation soon followed, but as promised, he resigned immediately. Behind him, his designated successor, Mohammed Saleh al-Ahmar, began his first address to parliament, promising to uphold the memory of his brother Ali Abdullah Saleh and commemorate the struggle his nephew had gone through to ensure the survival of the GPC during the corrupt years of Al-Islah."

saudi_yemen.28.t: "Saleh Amendment Passed Through Parliament"
saudi_yemen.28.d: "Today, President Saleh proposed a second constitutional amendment aimed at enshrining himself as President for life, establishing a clear line of succession for the position of President and at last resolving the political crisis that has lasted since the collapse of the Arab Republic in 1990. While concerns have raised over such an amendment, believing it would establish an unofficial monarchy in Yemen under the Saleh family, the President has reminded those wary of this amendment that it was only thanks to the Saleh family that any semblance of order existed during the decade long communist rebellion. With the legacy of the Saleh family in mind, many within the General People's Congress have accepted that the Saleh legacy will be a potent tool in restoring the nation, and voted in favour of the amendment. As such, with an overwhelming supermajority behind him in the parliament, President Saleh has now claimed Yemen for both himself and his descendents."

saudi_yemen.29.t: "Young Officers Arrest President Ashwal"
saudi_yemen.29.d: "At precisely nine o'clock this morning, elements of the army loyal to the anti-Ashwal clique arrested the now former President Ashwal on the grounds of treason, conspiracy with foreign agents and abuse of power. With the sudden loss of communications outside of the capital, and the majority of the armed forces stationed in the city on the side of the anti-Ashwal clique, the President was forced to abandon the Presidential palace and attempted to flee the city. All in vain, as his vehicle was discovered by one of the military checkpoints established along the outskirts of the city, and he was soon after placed under arrest. In a last-ditch attempt to rescue the former president, elements loyal to Ashwal attempted an ambush on the envoy escorting him out of Sana'a, leading to the deaths of fifty and injuring a further two hundred. With President Ashwal now waiting to face trial for his crimes against the people of Yemen, the clique opposed to his leadership has already inaugurated Sagheer bin Aziz as the new President of the Yemen Arab Republic, who has vowed to exorcise the scourge of corruption from parliament and at last restore prosperity to our nation."

saudi_yemen.30.t: "Parliament Amends Constitution"
saudi_yemen.30.d: "In its second session since the coup against former President Ashwal, parliament has today voted in favor of amending the outdated constitution, bringing it more in line with the wishes and values of the newly inaugurated President Aziz. Although debate had arisen surrounding whether the constitution should be suspended for the foreseeable future, following in the example of former President Hamdi, the President insisted that a new constitution was necessary. This new constitution would blend together traditions of the past and a vision for the future. Having received unanimous support from parliament, the amendment was passed successfully, bringing forth a new era for our nation. With married women, accompanied by their husbands, now being allowed to vote in parliamentary elections, political factionalism being constitutionally prohibited and the president being granted further powers to appoint representatives to parliament, many have praised President Aziz for his efforts in bringing stability unseen since the days of the Revolutionary Correction Movement under President Hamdi. Now, with the passage of this amendment, the nation eagerly awaits the continuation of these reforms in the hopes that the days of turmoil can at last be forgotten."

saudi_yemen.31.t: "Community Outreach Programs Established"
saudi_yemen.31.d: "On the order of President Aziz, an immediate expansion of the Local Development Agencies has been ordered, to facilitate further economic growth and crush the inequalities found across the nation. This expansion has focused upon the establishment of community outreach programs that shall focus on delivering vaccinations, food and fresh water to the most rural regions of our nation. While the conservative elements of parliament are concerned that this might bring the nation dangerously close to Nasserism, the policy has attracted widespread popular support, with many believing an expansion of the Local Development Agencies is necessary to ensure continued economic growth. With local councils to oversee the beginning of the programs on behalf of parliament being established, the President remains convinced that in time the inequalities that have plagued the nation for decades shall, at last, be rectified. As men, women and children across the nation finally receive the basic needs they have been calling out for since the end of the civil war, the President has addressed parliament, thanking its members for seeing the necessity of this act in order to crush inequality and ensure that the basic rights of Yemeni people are upheld. "

Beginning his speech by praising the dedication of the armed forces in their continued fight for freedom and self-determination for all Yemeni people, the President was met with thunderous applause from all in attendance. As the night fell over Sana'a, the President then lit a nearby torch to signify the strength of the continued revolution and encouraged all to hold within them that very flame. Continuing his speech, President [YEM.GetLeader] announced that further reforms were underway and that an era of renewed economic and cultural prosperity is near, at last marking an end to the long decades of failed governments. Having ended the speech with a stirring rendition of the national anthem, the President was soon escorted off the square to his car, after which was paraded through the city.

saudi_yemen.33.d: "The Yemeni government has approached ours, requesting our sponsorship into the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Yemeni oil fields are significantly underdeveloped, and are currently only deteriorating further due to the devastating effects of years of strife. Nevertheless, their government is convinced that, once the economy has recovered from its current depression, the production of the Marib oil fields will once again reach the levels of the early 1980s. Given our access to large quantities of the world's oil supply, granting us significant sway within OPEC, it is likely that our sponsorship of Yemen would lead to their entry, greatly increasing the influence of OPEC. However, whilst this request has been deemed reasonable by some royal advisors, others believe that the Yemeni government has no right to make such a request, given their position in relation to us. Presently, the oil extracted from Yemen is barrelled and sent to our distributors, who grant Yemen a small forty per cent share of the revenue and production. By allowing Yemen to join OPEC we would be forced to end this deal, granting Yemen full ownership of its oil production at a cost only to our profit margins."

Reports have now returned from our ambassadors stating that our allies in Saudi Arabia have agreed to sponsor our entry, bringing us into OPEC imminently. The President has now sent his thanks to the Saudi government for sponsoring our entry, believing that the organization will allow for the revitalization of our oil industry and further the ongoing economic recovery from the civil war. Furthermore, our ambassadors believe that our admission into OPEC will allow for an increase in support and recognition for our government from other prominent members of the organization. Although support for our nation is welcomed, elements of our government are worried that such recognition may implicitly be a declaration of independence from our Saudi benefactors."

saudi_yemen.35.d: "Following a brief period of negotiations with the Saudi Arabian government, our ambassadors have now returned from Riyadh regarding the meetings on our request for Saudi Arabia to sponsor our entry into the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. As anticipated by many within our government, the Saudi Arabians have declined to sponsor our entry, believing it would further destabilize our already fragile economy and disrupt trade between our nations. The President is reported to have already sent his acknowledgements to the Saudi government, reportedly respectful of their decision. While the President has been supported by the majority of his cabinet, some members of the Yemeni People's Union have criticised the President folding and are calling for a second attempt at joining OPEC. However, the President has shot down this criticism, rejecting it as nothing more than voices of a vocal minority of die-hard nationalists within the party."

saudi_yemen.36.t: "Yemen Proposes Joint Infrastructure Plan"
saudi_yemen.36.d: "Our embassy in Sana'a received a request for investment into a joint economic project. The desire of the Yemeni government would be for both our nations to construct an interconnected set of railways and highways. The centerpiece of this project is a proposed railway that would begin in Riyadh, crossing through the Yemeni town of Sa'dah before then connecting to their capital in Sana'a. The initial cost of such an investment is not estimated to be cheap, with conservative estimates beginning at thirty million riyals. Nevertheless, the cost of such an investment will also be repaid within the coming years as trade between our two nations develops further. Due to the high initial costs of the project, some royal advisors are arguing that the current state of trade between our two nations is more than adequate, and the development of such a railway system is an unnecessary expense. Even if the development would lead to a further increase in trade between our countries and perhaps diversify our economy slightly, there is very little that Yemen can offer us outside of our existing trade deals with them, possibly negating the necessity of this railway system."

saudi_yemen.37.d: "Our trade delegation to Saudi Arabia have today returned from lengthy negotiations in Riyadh, where they have now agreed on the development of a high speed rail system connecting Riyadh to Sana'a. The Saudi government has backed our proposal believing that it will lead to the eventual improvement of both our economies, as both tourism and resources can more easily cross the border. However, despite the success of the negotiations, the Saudi government has insisted that we pay for the majority of the project, requesting a fifty-five, forty-five per cent split between our governments. Although our ambassadors had pressed for an even fifty-fifty split, the Saudi government had refused to budge, believing that given the project was developed by our own economists, we should pay a majority of the expenses. While not what we had hoped, the Saudis covering forty-five percent of the costs still puts us well on the track to construction, as railway lines and highways has now already begun to be laid, with many eagerly anticipating the increase in trade from Riyadh."

saudi_yemen.38.d: "Our trade delegation have today returned from Riyadh following discussions regarding the development of a high-speed railway network connecting Sana'a with Riyadh. After days of negotiations, our delegation have sadly reported that the Saudi government will not be investing in this project. Having requested that our government pay for the majority of the project's development, our delegates had instead attempted to persuade the Saudi government to accept a fifty-fifty split, a compromise they were unwilling to accept. However, despite the Saudi government's rejection, our economists are convinced that the project can still go on without their aid, which would allow Sana'a to be connected with the remote town of Albuqa. Whilst many have questioned this watered-down proposition, tangible benefits to the plan in the form of a railway improving the lives of those in the region and beginning the process of modernization in one of our most remote towns are clear. Even though this rail line shall not be as intricate or developed as it would have been with Saudi investment, the economists are convinced the plan can still work."

saudi_yemen.39.t: "Yemen Seeks To Revive Trade Relations"
saudi_yemen.39.d: "In a surprise to many within the administration, a trade delegation from Yemen has recently arrived in Atlanta to discuss the possibility of restoring old relations. Although many had assumed that the new Yemeni government would hesitate to deal much with the outside world, it has become clear that its new leader, [YEM.GetLeader], wishes to restore the relations we had with the old Republic of Yemen. Having begun negotiations, it did not take long before their ambassadors brought up the matter of trade, requesting access to our industrial capabilities in return for access to some of their resources. While this deal would see an increase in resources for us, particularly oil, there is very little else Yemen can offer us and many have wondered if these new deals would be worth the investment. It is true that Yemen was once deemed a much-valued ally in the Middle East, its continued instability has left many within our government wary of dealing with the country, as any investments may be at risk from future unrest. Nevertheless, some feel this agreement is the least we can do to aid in Yemen's continued reconstruction efforts, given everything that has happened in the past."

The negotiations with President [USA.GetLeader]'s government surrounding the possibilities of restoring trade relations and agreements went well, and much to the delight of our government, the American ambassadors have accepted our proposal. Some within our government had feared that, due to Al-Islah having been toppled at the end of the civil war, the [USA.GetName] would not seek to deal with our government in fears of being once more entangled in the affairs of the Middle East. This turned out to thankfully not be the case and now fruitful relations have been restored between our two countries. At the moment, it is still unclear as to whether this agreement was a one time deal or if the American government would agree to deepen ties in the future, but regardless of the outcome, many within the country are relieved that our former ally still regards us worthy of their investment."

saudi_yemen.41.t: "The [USA.GetName] Refuses to Revive Trade Relations"
saudi_yemen.41.d: "After weeks of negotiations with the American government in Atlanta, our ambassadors have unfortunately returned emptyhanded from their attempts to revive former trade relations with our former ally. Despite having promised their government access to our natural resources, most importantly oil, the [USA.GetName] has rejected the restoration of trade relations and stated that, even with the end of the civil war and reestablishment of civil order across our country, our nation remains too unstable to warrant investment. This response has come as a shock to large parts of the government, who believed that we had proven ourselves a stable and safe nation to all the world. With the lack of American investment, it will take much longer for our economy to recover and modernize, with many left questioning where else we shall find the investment to better develop our civilian economy. Whilst it may take longer now for our economy to modernize, the government remains hopeful that, even without American support, our nation will soon see rapid levels of industrialisation and finally be brought into the twenty-first century."

saudi_yemen.42.d: "Another economic proposal from Yemen recently arrived in Riyadh, suggesting further development the shared oil fields near the border in the Sa'ada region. Whilst these oilfields have, in recent years, never been able to compete with our own production, the Yemeni government is convinced that with the use of modern drilling techniques these fields bring a lot more profit for both our nations. However, the resources needed to be invested in the region would be quite significant, given its aging equipment and general wear and tear. Some economists have suggested that even if more oil can be extracted, it would take years before we see any real profit. The investment remains a gamble for our government, with some recognizing the potential of new fields, but an undercurrent of pessimism is widespread, as a large group of self-described realists see it as nothing more than a waste of our resources that could be spent on existing oilfields. Regardless, the Yemeni government wholeheartedly believes the project will be beneficial for both of our nations, and if nothing else agreeing would be a sign of goodwill."

Much to the delight of our government, news are that the Saudi government has agreed to invest in the development of these oilfields, agreeing with the idea of sharing oil discoveries equally. Despite some initial skepticism that there is no oil to be found in the region, our ambassadors were able to convince them it was a worthy investment, after having shown a detailed plan of the region and where potential, sizable oil deposits could be found. With the Saudi government having now agreed to invest, work has already begun on the modernisation of existing oil fields, with further investment coming in from other regional oil barons looking to expand their businesses and maximize their profits."

saudi_yemen.44.d: "Today our ambassadors have returned from Riyadh following unsuccessful negotiations aimed at gaining Saudi investment for development of joint oil fields in the north. Having stated that the oil wells there have already extracted most of the oil reserves, the Saudi government was quick to end negotiations believing that the costs were too high compared with what could be extracted. Without these investments, our economists have projected that a smaller project can be established within the Marib oil fields. Despite this project being smaller than the development along the Saudi border, it would at least see our oil production improve slightly. Already plans have been drawn up to work on the expansion of the Marib oilfields, with many seeing it as a great success for our own development.

saudi_yemen.45.d: "In an effort to revitalize the economy, the government has today announced the sale of leading Yemeni businesses to members of the Saudi royal family. With promises to prioritize the continued expansion and development of production lines across the nation. With a closed-door auction for the industries, royalty from across the House of Saud were invited to Sana'a to bid on the properties, bringing in large sums for the government treasury. Concerns have been raised over the exceedingly dubious legality of the sales, as most of these companies are currently owned by other private actors, and whether the Saudi royalty will be true to its word. To assuage these concerns, guarantees have been made that the Saudi royalty will play no part in the day to day management of the sold companies, leaving that to current staff, with the Saudi royalty merely acting as a silent partner for these businesses. In response to this sale, workers across the sold companies have begun to strike against the government, fearing that the sales will see drastic cuts in their wages and slide the nation further into the palms of the Saudi government. With the police having now been dispatched to break the strikes, they are not expected to last long."

Having requested a small shipment of modern equipment, the Yemeni government has promised to pay for the shipment through the cessation of the region of Sa'ada. While an unorthodox method of payment, their government has stated that the region has shown promise for the discovery of oil fields, and that they have little else to trade us at the moment. However, it is obvious to all that Sa'ada remains a key stronghold for the Houthi rebellion and despite their leaders having been routed, minor pockets of resistance have continued to persist across the region. Accepting the Yemeni deal would in turn place responsibility for these terrorists into our hands, and many have wondered if this offer was nothing more than an attempt by the Yemeni government to pass the issue of Houthi resistance onto us. Despite this, some have considered the offer believing the extra territory and industry would be worth dealing with a handful of ill-equipped terrorists."

To the delight of our government, and our armed forces, the Saudi government has agreed to the exchange, allowing our government to focus entirely upon the southern border and leave the suppression of continued Houthi resistance to the Saudi government. Although many within the armed forces are thankful for Saudi governments transfer of weaponry, there have been reports of violence in response to the decision sell off Sa'ada, with numerous soldiers and civilians alike seeing it as high treason. In response to this deal, nationalists across Yemen have gone out into the streets, necessitating the usage of the armed forces to repress this uprising. As the dust is settling, the government has been left with a clear reminder that Yemeni nationalism remains a potent force and that extra measures will have to be taken to ensure continued stability. For the time being, extra security has been deployed in both Sa'ada and in Sana'a, as a means of securing the peace and keeping any further nationalist revolts down."

Much to the dismay of our armed forces, but not to some within our government, the Saudi government has rejected our offer, citing that our motive behind this deal was not to strengthen our armed forces, but rather to pass the trouble of the last remaining Houthi rebels onto them. Despite our ambassadors' best attempts to deny this preposterous claim, stating that the offer was nothing more than an attempt to end decades of division surrounding the northern border, the Saudi representatives were unwilling to discuss the matter further. Despite some having raised concerns over how the Saudi rejection will affect our continued military build-up, there are those who have viewed the rejection as an overall benefit to our continued rule, as the Yemeni people would not have taken this cessation of territory lightly. While resistance would have been easily put down, an armed rebellion would have significantly damaged our reputation and risked the stability fought so hard to achieve."

As preparations for his death have been in planning since the start of last decade, Sinan's son, Saba Sinan Abu Lahoum, has already agreed to become the new head of the Bakil tribe and continue his fathers legacy, as well as inherit his position within President [YEM.GetLeader]'s cabinet. This passing is felt across the nation, with representatives of tribes across the nation sending their condolences to the Bakil tribe, and granted offerings that will be displayed on his coffin as it will be carried through the streets of Sana'a, before being returned home to finally be laid to rest by his fellow tribesmen."

With a guilty verdict all but assured, the courts have worked to ensure that their 'president' not be given any opportunity to defend his actions, so as to prevent any rash actions by any leftover loyalists in the South. Therefore, the trial has been held in secret, with the populace only being informed that the former President is now in custody until future notice.

Whilst small cells of terrorists continue to plague the most remote regions of the south, especially the island of Socotra, it has become clear to all that the Yemeni nation is once more united under the government of [YEM.GetLeader]. With the old socialist order torn down, the government has now begun to bring the south's public institutions in line with the policies of the north, so that communism may finally be wiped from the hearts and minds of the south. Although some have criticized the government's approach to reintegrating the south, claiming it to be the exact same approach as the Al-Islah government following the end of the civil war in 2004, [YEM.GetLeader] has assured his critics that any attempts to reintegrate the south shall not end in failure, stating that the military has been granted sufficient powers to crack down on resistance and enforce the will of the government."

Having been allowed to tour a few factories in Sana'a and inspect the training of the Yemeni military, [SAU.GetLeader] eventually met with [YEM.GetLeader], where the two discussed the ongoing situation on the southern border and how prepared our military would be for an invasion. Having reassured our allies that the border remains under constant vigilance, with an estimate of eighty-thousand soldiers guarding the region. Afterwards, [SAU.GetLeader] turned his attention to our economic recovery, noting that the factories visited on his tour displayed clear signs of poor management. Having promised to invest in our industrial management, [SAU.GetLeader] returned to Riyadh, pleased with his findings.

While no statement has been given by the President confirmed whether reunification is the eventual goal, parliament has still debated the idea vigorously. With the Sana'a Doctrine's rebirth, most who remember the doctrine have celebrated its return, seeing it as a necessary step to better the nation.

Worrying reports have reached the President's desk, detailing how the tribes had been treated throughout the southern government's occupation of their land, ranging from deportations to outright conflict with the military, the reestablishment of tribal authority has been given utmost priority during the reconstruction of the south. Having met with representatives of various southern tribes, the government is committed to ensuring that all tribes of Yemen can exist free from oppression and preserve their traditions.

However, hardliners and unionists alike within the Council have questioned the legitimacy of this proposal, believing that the north seeks to do nothing more than spy on our government and subvert our Socialist project. While relations with the north have never been stable nor positive, with multiple wars fought between our two nations, the moderates are arguing that it is our duty to begin a new era in north-south relations and embrace coexistence.

With our representatives taken aback at this lie, the negotiations were immediately cut short. With further negotiations now seeming increasingly unlikely, it is evident that the southern government has failed to recognize a good deal when one presents itself, as this deal would have been mutually beneficial.

As representatives of the tribes across the nation plead with the government to be allowed onto this new council, the President is hopeful that thi measure will revitalize government relations with the tribes and revive our long-standing alliance. While it is clear that all tribes across the country are willing to serve in the council, as to win both representation and economic investment, the revival of the tribal alliance is all but assured.

With the passage of this act, the President has now officially renounced all territorial claims on the south, stating that the continued division of Yemen is the only way to avoid further bloodshed and ensure a lasting peace. The effects of the act have already been noticeable across the country, with many celebrating the end of hostilities with the south and others protesting the government, demanding an immediate repeal of the act. With education being reformed to promote the northern values, it is evident that the President's decision will not easily be overturned and that any protests against the act will likely fall on deaf ears.

Now in an effort to ensure Yemen retains the goodwill of the Saudi Arabian government, the President has directly intervened and overruled his own delegation, stating that he will decide what economic plan to follow. The first of such plans was the draft initially presented at the Riyadh Conference, maintaining our close ties to Saudi Arabia and working to establish an export based economy that would prioritize the growth of our oil industry. The second, and most controversial option, would see the restoration of Al-Islah's policies prioritizing foreign investment and working closely with corporations to ensure economic development.

Now with all ties to the Saudi government severed, economists believe it necessary to reevaluate our decision and decide once and for all the economic model of Yemen. The first model would see our government following in the footsteps of the Al-Islah government, seeking foreign investment and attempting to rekindle relations with America. Although an unpopular model, many have argued that it would be necessary solely for the foreign investment that would come from this. The second model would see our government attempt to reform the Local Development Agencies to work in the modern era, hopefully establishing an economy that works for all regardless of the cost.

However, it appears that Saudi Arabia looks ill upon the declaration, and at long last giving a response, summoning our government to Riyadh immediately to explain this 'insolent action'. This request has been publicly rejected by the President, who has declared that the Saudi government has neither the authority nor the right to summon our government to their capital.

With no further response from their government, despite having now sent numerous requests to their so-called President, the government has safely concluded that the Yemeni government has gone rogue and become a hostile entity. With calls for the immediate invasion of the country in the government, there can only be one natural response to this petty rebellion.

Although normally our government would be unwilling to align with the movement, our generals have welcomed their support and equipment which is already being deployed at key locations to hold off the Saudis. However, whilst the UYF volunteers are a welcome addition to our armed forces, some have raised concerns over their zealous combat doctrine, as they frequently attempt to push beyond our defensive positions to attack enemy garrisons, even when no order to do so has been given.

Contained within each of the sixty-one letters was the claim the President had failed to understand the necessity for a return to the 1978 constitution of President Saleh, and have openly called for the President to reestablish the General People's Congress and step down. With these politicians representing over a third of parliament, being one of the largest blocs, their concern cannot be easily avoided, and some believe it is in the best interest of the President to concede to their demands. Having already ruled out such a proposal, President Ashwal has insisted that he can reunite parliament under his leadership.

Having been assassinated as a response to his purge of the compromise government established during the Eryani presidency, the Vice-President had hoped to use Hamdi's death as a means of securing his own power and to halt reunification. On the orders of suspected Saudi agents, President Hamdi and his brother were assassinated and taken to the outskirts of Sana'a, where two French nationals were then executed to add legitimacy to the cover story. Whilst it has not been confirmed how involved Saudi Arabia was in the assassination, the publication of this report has answered many questions the family and the populace have had since 1977 and has, at last, brought peace to the surviving members of Hamdi's family."

saudi_yemen.75.d:0 "In an attempt to increase the legitimacy of the new government. President Ahwal’s has now on Saudi beckoning given his first address to the new Yemeni National State. In the address, the President praised the valiant effort of the Saudi military in their efforts to restore order to our country and personally thanked [SAU.GetLeader] for helping us stand firm against Communism. As the speech progressed, President Ahwal continued his thanks to the Saudi government, stating that Yemen will forever be grateful to their government and that only through greater cooperation will the scars of the civil war be able to heal. While the speech is hoped to have eased tensions between the government and the people by high ranking officials, the reality of the situation could not be further from this assumption. The President's words have now ignited a renewed wave of protest against the government, with many seeing the speech as confirmation that the nation now operates as nothing more than a puppet to Riyadh."

saudi_yemen.76.d:0 "Today, reports have arrived on President Ahwal’s desk, detailing an increase in seditious activity near the border regions with the People’s Democratic Republic. Initially, this activity was believed to have been agents of the South Yemeni government, however, after further investigation and the capture of several rebels it has been revealed to be the work of a recently established nationalist group, with ties to both the former Al-Islah government and to Saleh's old alliance. This so-called United Yemeni Front claims to represent the legitimate government of Yemen and is calling for the removal of President Ahwal, claiming him to be a puppet of the Saudi government. It is unclear as to how well organized these terrorists are, but it is obvious that they are well-armed and capable of going toe to toe with our armed forces. To prevent another civil war, significant effort is being made to preserve normalcy, with patrols doubled in all major cities and martial law being declared in certain towns. With our intelligence agencies reporting activity in the areas near Marib, the President and the armed forces are keeping a close eye on the situation."

saudi_yemen.77.d:0 "In a lightning night attack by the United Yemeni Front, Marib has now fallen into terrorist hands. With only limited fighting reported, it has been assumed that large portions of the town garrison have surrendered to the occupying force, after realizing all communication outside of the town had been cut. Despite reports having detailed movement towards Marib, our armed forces were held back until the town had fallen into the hands of the terrorists in an effort to draw out its leaders, setting up a trap for them. With intelligence claiming it is likely that the leaders of the UYF are now in Marib, plans have been drawn up to retake the town, beginning with the encirclement of the region to ensure that none shall slip through our net. Despite the limited fighting in the city, reports indicate that damage to the town's industrial district is extensive, due to widespread usage of explosives during fighting. The President has now authorized the armed forces to use whatever means necessary to retake the town, but has been informed that the town may remain under UYF control for a few weeks while preparations are made."

saudi_yemen.78.d:0 "As expected by President Ashwal and most of the military high command, the Saudi Arabian government has now begun its attempted reconquest of our nation. In a supposedly surprise invasion, Saudi forces attempted to cross our borders in the dead of night but have now been successfully repelled by our armed forces along the border. With fighting continuing along the border President Ashwal has laid out the strategy for the defense of Yemen, hoping to bog the Saudi army down into an unwinnable war of attrition that will inevitably force their government to sue for peace. Whilst an ambitious plan, with none sure as to how long it would take to force the Saudis to accept peace terms, morale amongst the army is high and all soldiers have recognized the importance of the upcoming battle against our former tyrants. To further improve the morale of the country, President Ashwal has now spoken to the nation in a televised address ordering all to serve their country in whatever manner they can, reminding them that the fate of Yemen rests in the hands of every citizen. As our soldiers prepare for further assaults by the Saudi military, our nation stands at a crossroads with our future being determined by the outcome of this conflict."

news.327.d:0 "Following the end of the civil war in which the north of the country was occupied by the Saudi Arabian government, most had assumed that Yemen's fate as a lapdog of the Saudi monarchy was all but assured. However, following a recent coup against the Saudi backed President the newly established military junta has been successful in its attempts to secure independence. Having successfully forced the Saudi armed forces into a war of attrition, the Yemeni government was able to dictate peace terms onto the Saudi government which called for the immediate withdrawal of all Saudi military presence in Yemen, reparations for damages caused during the war and recognition of the new state. The international community has already sent its congratulations to the new Yemeni government for achieving its independence. However, such congratulations have fallen on deaf ears with the new government requesting answers as to why no nation was willing to stand up for the rights of the Yemeni people during the immediate occupation of the country. With Yemen having now resecured its independence the government has pledged to begin rebuilding the country and has begun the reforms necessary to save the country from further destabilization."

news.328.d:0 "In the wake of a recent military coup against the former government, the Saudi Arabian armed forces have now put an end to all military insurrection in North Yemen once more restoring order to the region. With the Yemeni military now utterly defeated, and its short-lived military government now on trial for their alleged crimes, the Saudi government has established a new government. However, rather than allow for Yemen to be led by one of its own the Saudi monarchy has instead appointed the son of King Faisal, Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, as Yemen's new prince. Some within the international community have once more spoken out against the occupation, stating that the occupation is the beginning of a cultural genocide and have demanded that the Saudi government respect the rights of the Yemeni citizens. However, with the threat of increased oil prices, many have let the matter go following a statement that the rights of the Yemeni people will not be violated and that the decision to place Prince Turki as the head of government has stemmed from the need for a stronger leader in the region. With this appointment, many believe that the Yemeni nation as it is known has been confined to the history books."

news.329.d:0 "With the recent conflict now subsided and order once again being restored order to north Yemen, many had expected the Saudi government to reestablish their recently collapsed puppet regime restoring either former President Mohammed Ali al-Ahwal to the head of government or appointing a new, more favorable, government. However, such a restoration has not been seen, and it has become increasingly obvious to the international community that the Saudi Arabian government has elected to annex the north Yemeni region. Following their victory, [SAU.Getleader] announced that given the recent political crisis in Yemen the Saudi armed forces needed to occupy the region in its entirety to quell continued terrorist cells and once and for all restore order. Whilst many have criticized the Saudi government for their clear attempts at imperialism, these criticisms have been rejected with Saudi ambassadors having claimed that once order is restored to Yemen the armed forces shall leave allowing for the self-determination of the Yemeni people. However, the legitimacy of these promises have been brought into question and many believe that the Saudis will continue to occupy the region for as long as possible."

MOHAMMAD_ALI_AL_AHWAL_DESC: "Mohammad Ali al-Ahwal has served his country in numerous positions since the start of his career in 1975. Beginning as the Director-General of the Central Bank of Yemen from 1985 to 1995, where he used his influence to fund the General People's Congress in the first general election of a united Yemen, Ahwal's influence within politics only furthered in 1992 where he was appointed treasurer of the General People's Congress. By the outbreak of the civil war and the subsequent death of President Saleh, Ahwal soon joined Al-Islah who had begun to gain the international backing of the American Republic and Saudi Arabia. Following the 2004 general election, his experience within the General People's Congress was noted by then President Mohammad Qahtan who soon thereafter appointed Ahwal to a variety of positions within government ranging from a member of the Presidential Council to the Deputy Prime Minister for Finance. In these positions, Ahwal oversaw the foundations of economic stability in Yemen and used his ties to the Central Bank to gain the favor of Saudi officials. In 2007, following a cabinet reshuffle, Ahwal was once again granted further influence in government and was appointed as the Yemeni ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Facilitating the signature of several economic agreements, Ahwal presided over immense popularity within Al-Islah. However, with the recent Saudi intervention into the Yemeni civil war, Ahwal now stands in the one position he never asked for, President of Yemen, and only time will tell whether he is capable enough to lead his beloved nation."
