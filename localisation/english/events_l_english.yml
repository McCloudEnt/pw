The Prime Minister has continiously inspected the many complexes around the city, promoting Nagano for other reasons, like architecture, food and anything else that might attract more tourists to Japan.

Suddenly, as the true nature of this situation struck the Communist Party too late, the army was marching towards the Kremlin to arrest the entire government in the name of Chairman Rutskoy. Party leaders in all major cities were thrown in jail and Rutskoy's allies started to converge in the capital, finally confirming the Politburo's suspicions that the Chairman was indeed behind this treason.

Instead, the Party chose to avoid instant rebellion against their leader, with Eduard Limonov marching into the Kremlin alongside his loyal guards just yesterday. While the details of his apparent meeting with Rutskoy are unknown, it is clear that the National Bolshevik leader was forceful with our Chairman who was later escorted out of the building by armed guards. The last words uttered by Eduard Limonov were supposedly 'I'm sorry sir, it's time for you to leave'.

That report we cast aside just a few months ago concerning Tsar Vladimir's possible desires to meddle directly in our domestic affairs has come all too true. As of now, the Queen has proclaimed to the Danish people that she shall regain power in this country no matter the cost. Her loyalists and even other groups are staging uprisings around the country. What are we going to do?"
 soviet.32.o1:0 "Crush them"
 soviet.33.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 soviet.33.d:0 "Now Alexander Rutskoy must create a concrete foreign affairs doctrine for his new administration. If he continues on his path of policy uncertainty then this great nation will fall behind on the world stage."

 soviet.33.o3:0 "We dance with the world"
 soviet.34.t:0 "Alliance With the Soviets"
 soviet.34.d:0 "Our split with the Soviet Union has created significant issues for China in the past, especially as the USSR became the sole superpower on the planet. However, now with a completely new government in Moscow and the climactic end to Gorbachev's rebellion against the establishment complete, the Soviets have requested an alliance between our two nations. Should we accept this extremely generous offer, or could this be a ploy to simply gain more power in Asia and restrict our dominance?"
 soviet.34.o1:0 "China will join"
 soviet.34.o2:0 "There will be no alliance"
 soviet.35.t:0 "China Refuses"
 soviet.35.d:0 "The pretentious Chinese government has responded to our request for a formal alliance with disdain. It seems they were implying that an alliance would restrict China's vision for Asia and that we were attempting to sideline their expanding influence, and hence could never accept such an agreement. But our request was completely out of goodwill and in the spirit of socialist cooperation..."
 soviet.35.o1:0 "Right?"
 soviet.36.t:0 "China Accepts"
 soviet.36.d:0 "The cooperative Chinese government has responded to our request for a formal alliance with great enthusiasm. It seems although they were having second thoughts concerning China's supposed diminished influence under this alliance, the Politburo eventually decided to accept our generous offer. Finally China and the Soviet Union can be united in ideology once again!"

 soviet.37.t:0 "Increased Oil Drilling"
 soviet.37.d:0 "Oil drilling in the Caspian Sea has increased exponentially since our last report was compiled, supposedly directly linked to recent government policy concerning the resource's extraction. This is excellent news not just for the economy but also for our expanding military."
 soviet.37.o1:0 "Wonderful"
 soviet.38.t:0 "New Interest in Agriculture"
 soviet.38.d:0 "The Kremlin has announced a renewed interest in agriculture throughout the nation, and how it can be utilised to resolve the economic issues plagueing it. This 'renewed interest' apparently comes in the form of subsidies, easing quotas and developing new technologies for harvesting and growing."
 soviet.38.o1:0 "Interesting"
 soviet.39.t:0 "Economy Moves Towards Growth"
 soviet.39.d:0 "Analysts of the national economy have confirmed today that we are definitely taking large steps towards growth, but we still apparently have a long way to go until that point is reached. Until now, we must remain pleased that the first stage of our economic recovery has been completed."
 soviet.39.o1:0 "Wonderful"
 soviet.40.t:0 "Gorbachev Purges Politburo"
 soviet.40.d:0 "Early this morning Chairman Gorbachev ordered the arrest of various Politburo members seen as too conservative for his government. These members have either openly defied Gorbachev's advocacy for reforms or even participated in the worldwide hunt for him back in the 1990s. It seems karma has come back to bite the conservatives however, as now their political careers are ruined and their lives may very well be in danger of a swift end."
 soviet.40.o1:0 "Good riddance"
 soviet.41.t:0 "Unholy Deal"
 soviet.41.d:0 "A truly unexpected and near-impossible treaty has just been signed by Chairman Gorbachev and separatists throughout the Union. Seen as traitors by most citizens, Gorbachev extended an olive branch not too long ago to this dissidents, who gladly accepted a way out of their pitiful resistance. Our leader later forged a deal which would grant certain Republics more investment and representation by proclaiming loyalty to Moscow."
 soviet.41.o1:0 "A good deal?"
 soviet.42.t:0 "Gorbachev Announces New Reforms"
 soviet.42.d:0 "Chairman Gorbachev made an unsurprising announcement to both the Soviet Union and the world this morning when he declared the government would enact further reforms. Unlike his past orders, these 'further reforms' are considered to be our leader's true vision for the Union, with far more civil liberties and a relatively open economy."
 soviet.42.o1:0 "Where are the Chairman's enemies"
 soviet.43.t:0 "Reformist Dreams Crushed"
 soviet.43.d:0 "Chairman Gorbachev made a startling announcement to both the Soviet Union and the world this morning when he declared the government would not enact any further major reforms. He claims that his most recent reforms were all he desired for the Union and that he would work to preserve the 'glorious nation that it already is'. To reformists and most believers in Gorbachev's leadership, this is a crushing blow seen by some as betrayal. But the majority of these supporters are circling conspiracy theories that indicate the conservatives have threatened Chairman Gorbachev."
 soviet.43.o1:0 "A child's fantasy"
 soviet.44.t:0 "Alliance of the Enemies"
 soviet.44.d:0 "Reformist and hardliner Chairman Gorbachev and Vladimir Putin respectively were seen laughing together and enjoying a hushed discussion before they held a press conference this morning in the Kremlin. Gorbachev dispelled any more rumours relating to his possible future reforms and the chief of the KGB stated his state service now has complete confidence in Gorbachev's administration. Another major blow to the Chairman's radical supporters who vehemently oppose the KGB."
 soviet.44.o1:0 "We are indivisible"
 soviet.45.t:0 "Crackdown on Dissent"
 soviet.45.d:0 "These radical revolutionaries without a cause or leader to follow have been allowed to persist for too long. While the Soviet Union has been condemned for totalitarianism by our enemies in the past, only now will the traitors within this nation be destroyed... and finally the myth of Gorbachev's radical reformist views will be put to rest."
 soviet.45.o1:0 "I've had enough"
 soviet.46.t:0 "Rutskoy's Pledge"
 soviet.46.d:0 "Part of a faction within the Politburo based around economic reform but nationalistic support for the Soviet Union, Alexander Rutskoy has quickly become a controversial leader. Radical reformists are pulling him from one angle and conservatives from the other, but the Chairman seems to have remained relatively neutral. Today he pledged to the nation that the economy would be reformed, but any radical change proposed by the likes of Gorbachev is simply nonsense."
 soviet.46.o1:0 "Interesting"
 soviet.47.t:0 "Economic Reforms End"
 soviet.47.d:0 "While some reformists were hoping for extensive changes from the Kremlin, Chairman Rutskoy seems to have honoured his pledge not too long ago concerning economic reforms in the Soviet Union. In that statement, it was implied that the nation would never see extensive changes to the economy, rather a limited reform of the system guided by Rutskoy's nationalist faction. A few hours ago the Kremlin announced that as of now there would be no more reforms enacted by the administration, and that an era of stability is nearing."
 soviet.47.o1:0 "Ok"
 soviet.48.t:0 "Rutskoy Announces Free Market Reforms"
 soviet.48.d:0 "In his first pledge to the Soviet people, Chairman Rutskoy implied that there would only be economic reforms that followed the principles of his nationalist Politburo faction. This meant that radical reformists no longer believed in extensive changes ordered by Yazov's successor and the conservatives were satisfied. However, to the shock of the world, Rutskoy has just announced that he will enact various laws to establish a relatively free market in the Soviet Union. While it won't be similar to the old Western capitalist systems, this new economy will certainly bring great change to our nation."
 soviet.48.o1:0 "Traitor or hero?"
 soviet.49.t:0 "New Shift to Eurasianism"
 soviet.49.d:0 "The Eurasian movement has fell on hard times recently, with its leadership broken up outside of the Soviet Union and Chairman Yazov's repeated rejection of their values. However, with his successor's apparent ultranationalism and unusual, unpredictable opinions, there has been a growth in support for Eurasianism."
 soviet.49.o1:0 "Interesting"
 soviet.50.t:0 "Baltic Terror"
 soviet.50.d:0 "Eurasianism's rapid growth in support these recent months has caused great concern in the Baltic Republics, where many still hold dear to the vision of independence. This value has surely been crushed by the prospect of a united Eurasia, a nation where no irrelevant Baltic populace has the need for a state. Despite this possible demoralisation, Chairman Rutskoy has taken significant steps to destroy separatism in the region for many years to come, by ordering a crackdown on all movements especially in Lithuania and Estonia."
 soviet.50.o1:0 "Resistance is futile"
 soviet.51.t:0 "New Members Arrive"
 soviet.51.d:0 "An 'Equal Politburo' has been established in Moscow, with Chairman Rutskoy completely reshuffling the body and placing more minority leaders from Republics like Turkmenistan in positions. This act will supposedly create more representation for 'sidelined' nationalities within the Soviet Union. Hence this could be one of the most important meetings of Rutskoy's early leadership, as members of the new Politburo gather in our capital to discuss a variety of issues concerning this Union."
 soviet.51.o1:0 "Great"
 soviet.52.t:0 "The Union First Speech"
 soviet.52.d:0 "Workers of the world can only unite when a strong leader takes charge and commands the nation he is meant to lead, not a congress of small parties who have little to offer to this great world revolution. If we focus on unpredictable cooperation and a tense idea of brotherhood, then neither the Soviet Union or Communism can progress into the future. For now, it is the Union first... and the Union only."
 soviet.52.o1:0 "Show them what we're made of"
 soviet.53.t:0 "Independence Groups Crushed"
 soviet.53.d:0 "Chairman Zyuganov arrived in Moscow this morning after a long week of relaxation in Ukraine. The first thing on his desk was an outstanding report detailing the breaking up of independence groups throughout the Union. In particular, Baltic and Caucasian separatist organisations were raided and their leaders arrested, as these areas were seen as the most active by the KGB."
 soviet.53.o1:0 "Good riddance"
 soviet.54.t:0 "Zyuganov Announces Political Recovery Plan"
 soviet.54.d:0 "There is no doubt that the assassination of our dear Chairman Yazov has created an undesirable atmosphere of instability and uncertainty in the Union. But as citizens of this great nation, we must always pull through and recover from disaster either at home or abroad. Throughout my term as Chairman we shall recover the political system from terror and we will recover the Soviet dream for eternity."
 soviet.54.o1:0 "For eternity indeed"
 soviet.55.t:0 "Death of Gorbachev"
 soviet.55.d:0 "Since his attempted arrest in the 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev has remained in exile. For decades since the Soviet government has tried to determine his location and either bring him back for trial or save the time and assassinate him. However these attempts have become fruitless, with reports suggesting the KGB quit the operation years ago. Instead, there has been a completely unexpected turn of events in the city of Chicago. After receiving reports of gunshots, the local police discovered Gorbachev had just committed suicide through two shots in the back of his head. The ageing former politician had been living in this inner city apartment for years now, unknown to the Chicago authorities and especially hidden from any Soviet spies."
 soviet.55.o1:0 "A truly unfortunate end, Comrade"
 soviet.56.t:0 "Reformists Purged"
 soviet.56.d:0 "Gorbachev's escape from the Soviet Union was predicted to be the end of reformism within the Soviet Union as we knew it, but still to this day members of his radical faction were found to be operating at the highest level of Soviet administration. Past leaders have let this situation continue, but Chairman Putin has had enough of the traitors within our ranks. Last night the KGB rounded up all known Gorbachev-collaborators and radicals throughout the Soviet Union, while the Chairman himself made a proclamation to the whole world. If anyone wants to bring us down... there will be hell."
 soviet.56.o1:0 "Good riddance"
 soviet.57.t:0 "Politburo Voices Concerns"
 soviet.57.d:0 "Several members of the Politburo met with Chairman Putin today to voice their concerns with the path of his administration. They stated that his recent lack of cooperation with the body and secret meetings with his military command has created suspicion throughout the nation. Leaders from various Republics have apparently begun to think Putin is trying to sideline the Politburo and hence enforce his totalitarian power over all Soviet peoples, far more so than his predecessors. Upon leaving, the aforementioned members told Mr. Putin that if this continues they will have no choice but to outright question the path of his leadership."
 soviet.57.o1:0 "Nonsense... Mr. Putin just has a different way of running things"
 soviet.58.t:0 "March on Moscow"
 soviet.58.d:0 "Early this morning Chairman Putin decided to retreat to his personal home in Belarus without informing the Politburo and hardly any of his ministers. This immediately worried the highest administrative bodies who were expecting a regular Moscow day. These worries were worsened when several military high commands around the Soviet Union cut off communication with the Politburo, while simultaneously troops in Moscow and Leningrad began to leave their barracks. Suddenly, as the true nature of this situation struck the Communist Party too late, the army was marching towards the Kremlin to arrest the entire government in the name of Chairman Putin. Party leaders in all major cities were thrown in jail and Putin's allies started to converge in the capital, finally confirming the Politburo's suspicions that the Chairman was indeed behind this treason. Just an hour later, Vladimir returned and announced the end of the Communist Party."
 soviet.58.o1:0 "The country is in chaos! What will happen now?"
 soviet.59.t:0 "Putin's Supreme Leadership Proclaimed"
 soviet.59.d:0 "The sudden March on Moscow ignited discussion both within the Soviet Union and abroad, concerning the March on Rome in the 1920s which led to Benito Mussolini's rise to power. This apparent connection was mainly made by Chairman Putin's opponents, who were hoping to simply label him a Fascist. But now as the great leader summoned politicians and other key figures from around the nation, he has done exactly what his opponents suspected, declaring himself Supreme Leader of Eurasia."
 soviet.59.o1:0 "Long live Putin!"
 soviet.60.t:0 "Military Junta Established"
 soviet.60.d:0 "Vladimir Putin must have known a one-man autocracy surrounding his leadership would not be efficient and could easily be the catalyst for a violent revolt against him. Instead, the Supreme Leader has decided to establish a military junta consisting of his finest commanders and some of his longtime allies. This junta has been granted extensive powers throughout the state and will surely become key players in the new political society of Eurasia."
 soviet.60.o1:0 "Long live Putin or the Junta?"
 soviet.61.t:0 "Inauguration of President Putin"
 soviet.61.d:0 "After taking total control over the Soviet Union in the now infamous March on Moscow, Vladimir Putin's opponents and allies have been eagerly waiting for his next move, especially what path he will take the Union on. For now it seems Putin wishes to establish a regime similar to that of the American Republic, with a patriotic civilian government in Moscow and himself as the glorious President. An event truly never before seen publicly in the Soviet Union or Russia, Chairman Putin was inaugurated as President of Eurasia to outstanding fanfare and a motorcade through the capital."
 soviet.61.o1:0 "President Putin shall save us"
 soviet.62.t:0 "New Admirals Arrive in Moscow"
 soviet.62.d:0 "Not too long ago the Kremlin issued an announcement detailing naval policy. This document seemed to imply that the government had lost faith in its old guard of admirals, and explicitly called for certain eminent navy leaders to come to Moscow today. These admirals arrived a few hours ago, ready for their meeting with the military command and our leader to discuss possible higher positions within the navy."
 soviet.62.o1:0 "Great"
 soviet.63.t:0 "Gorbachev Condemns Cults of Personality"
 soviet.63.d:0 "The cults of personality surrounding Soviet leaders since Joseph Stalin have been core values of the Union's society. Although these 'cults' were reduced in strength and fervor for post-Stalin leaders, Soviet citizens were always taught about the greatness of his successors, in particular Grigory Romanov. However, today Chairman Gorbachev openly condemned all cults of personality in the history of this nation, calling them 'disgusting' and 'fascistic'."
 soviet.63.o1:0 "A bold move"
 soviet.64.t:0 "Perestroika Begins"
 soviet.64.d:0 "Perestroika or Restructuring is the first major reform based on Chairman Gorbachev's vision for a new Soviet Union. The economic plan involves less central planning and more independence for state enterprises. The official beginning of this reform has sent shockwaves through the conservative factions of the Politburo and especially the hardliners within the KGB and other areas of Soviet society. Gorbachev must tread carefully with these reforms, or there may be no Soviet Union left to restructure..."
 soviet.64.o1:0 "We like to live dangerously"
 soviet.65.t:0 "Glasnost Begins"
 soviet.65.d:0 "Glasnost or Openness is the second major reform based on Chairman Gorbachev's vision for a new Soviet Union. The plan involves increased openness and transparency in government institutions and activities in the USSR. Glasnost reflects a commitment to getting Soviet citizens to discuss publicly the problems of their system and seek solutions. After the beginning of Perestroika hitting conservatives hard, it was expected that those factions would already be ready for such a radical set of reforms. But instead the conservatives have been even more shocked by the declaration of Glasnost."
 soviet.65.o1:0 "Freedom is not free"
 soviet.66.t:0 "Speech Review"
 soviet.66.d:0 "Mr. Chairman, am I right to believe you intentionally wrote this upcoming speech? It details the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the destruction of everything we have worked towards this past century and quite possibly the end of Communism as we know it. If this truly is going to be your declaration to the people then I can do little to stop you... but I can simply ask you: What the hell are you doing?"
 soviet.66.o1:0 "The union is lost"
 soviet.67.t:0 "Shift to Democracy"
 soviet.67.d:0 "There has been a noticeable shift to the ideals of capitalist democracy in recent months, with associations established after Glasnost began openly endorsing a new democratic Union of Sovereign States. This supposed 'New Union' could be the brainchild of Mikhail Gorbachev, but for now the Chairman has done little to indicate his outright support for the democratic movement."
 soviet.67.o1:0 "Interesting"
 soviet.68.t:0 "Revolutionary Elements in Government"
 soviet.68.d:0 "Intelligence reports indicate revolutionary socialism is taking a hold of our central government, with some members of this administration shifting to the signature views of the rival ideology. While this will create tension in Moscow and throughout the Union, these revolutionary socialist elements will certainly support Chairman Gorbachev's radical reforms."
 soviet.68.o1:0 "Interesting"
 soviet.69.t:0 "Gorbachev Removed From Office"
 soviet.69.d:0 "Chairman Gorbachev awoke this morning to shocking news. Radical reformists within the Soviet government had decided that their leader was not ready to go all the way with democracy and further liberalisation of the Union, and set themselves on a war path. Just a few hours ago, the commander of this large clique took Gorbachev's position as Chairman within the Congress, declaring himself the new paramount leader of this Soviet Union. As his allies flock to the new order and the people throw their support behind a democratic government, it is clear that there is no chance Mikhail could stay in power."
 soviet.69.o1:0 "It was necessary"
 soviet.70.t:0 "Union of Sovereign States Proclaimed"
 soviet.70.d:0 "Leaders of all Soviet Republics convened in Moscow today to sign an agreement that will decide the world's future for decades to come. The leaders agreed to dissolve the Soviet Union and establish a Union of Sovereign States in its place, a democratic, liberal and state capitalist confederation. According to the Chairman and his closest allies, this will finally resolve most issues within the Union and secure stability for all Soviet peoples."
 soviet.70.o1:0 "Long live the new union"
 soviet.71.t:0 "Gorbachev Purges KGB"
 soviet.71.d:0 "They came overnight. The Red Army marched into the headquarters of our most secure state organisation and arrested countless people. As the Chairman woke early in his Crimean vacation home, the half of the KGB hardliners had already been taken into custody or forced to flee the Soviet Union. However, with the situation now under control, chief Vladimir Putin and past candidate for the paramount leadership is yet to be found. Reports from the East indicate that he could be attempting to unite the remaining hardliners into an insurrectionary force designed to take down Gorbachev's reformist government."
 soviet.71.o1:0 "Good riddance"
 soviet.72.t:0 "Politburo Develops Eurasian Sympathies"
 soviet.72.d:0 "It seems the radicals advocating for a 'Eurasian' state are beginning to infect the highest levels of government. Reports from the KGB indicate that certain members of the Politburo are developing sympathy towards the Eurasian movement and its leaders, and could possibly advocate for it eventually. Surely this is just a fringe group, and will do little to affect the Chairman's leadership..."
 soviet.72.o1:0 "Intriguing"
 soviet.73.t:0 "Conservatives Voice Concerns"
 soviet.73.d:0 "Conservative and hardline members of the Politburo have voiced their concerns over Rutskoy's apparent endorsement of the Eurasian movement. The 'Eurasia Speech' as it has been dubbed by certain analysts, was delivered to the Congress with great fervor on the part of Chairman Rutskoy, who it seems believes this movement will save the Soviet Union. His description of the economy as disastrous and the political system as 'disgustingly corrupt' came as a shock to many, both within and outside the Soviet Union."
 soviet.73.o1:0 "Who asked for their opinion?"
 soviet.74.t:0 "Romanovs Return to Russia"
 soviet.74.d:0 "The morning had only just begun when a small private jet landed at the international airport of Moscow. The relatively unmarked aircraft was noticed by few, but in just a few hours ago, the world's media was spinning with the news that the Romanov family had returned to Russia. On the plane was the pretender, his wife and other relatives, who apparently pushed for radical anti-Soviet dissidents in Moscow to seize control after Rutskoy's coup. In the ensuing chaos, the Romanovs established control over what was left of the government. Now they have returned and the future of the Soviet Union has taken a very unexpected turn."
 soviet.74.o1:0 "An interesting development"
 soviet.75.t:0 "Coronation of the Tsar"
 soviet.75.d:0 "As the first Tsar and Tsarina of the Eurasian Empire stepped down the steps and onto the velvet carpet laid out in front of them, the hundreds standing at either side fell silent. The sheer presence of two people who are now the most powerful on the planet created an atmosphere of awe, possibly not seen since the era of Stalin. Today the pretender to the deposed throne of Russia was restored to this rightful position as Tsar of Eurasia. Now the long road to stability begins."

 soviet.76.d:0 "In the chaos following Rutskoy's unexpected coup in Moscow, it could not be predicted by anyone what faction would finally seize control and influence Chairman Rutskoy to their position. Now though, it seems the man himself has asserted his own faction as the dominant power in Moscow, preparing a national address this morning. After telling the Soviet people what they wanted to hear... a future of stability, security and peace within the Union, Chairman Rutskoy declared himself Autocrat of Eurasia with the full support of his government."

Now though, it seems that the National Bolshevik factions have asserted their party and views as the dominant power in Moscow, meeting with Chairman Rutskoy this morning. A coalition between the National Bolsheviks and Rutskoy's government has been established, and many analysts suspect this was orchestrated to ensure the legitimacy of a future Eurasian state."

 soviet.78.d:0 "Alexander Rutkosy's recently established military leadership was met with fierce resistance from several factions, but the most opposition was seen in the left. In response to this direct threat to his administration, Rutskoy ordered a radical purge of all progressive factions within the Soviet Union.

These worries were worsened when several military high commands around the Soviet Union cut off communication with the Politburo, while simultaneously troops in Moscow and Leningrad began to leave their barracks. Suddenly, as the true nature of this situation struck the Communist Party too late, the army was marching towards the Kremlin to arrest the entire government in the name of Chairman Rutskoy. Party leaders in all major cities were thrown in jail and Rutskoy's allies started to converge in the capital, finally confirming the Politburo's suspicions that the Chairman was indeed behind this treason. Just an hour later, Alexander returned and announced the end of the Communist Party, pledging his support for the Eurasian movement."

Policy decisions by Alexander have been met with significant backlash and many have begun to expect a civil war between the administration and Rutskoy's loose leadership. Instead, the Party chose to avoid instant rebellion against their leader, with Eduard Limonov marching into the Kremlin alongside his loyal guards just yesterday. While the details of his apparent meeting with Rutskoy are unknown, it is clear that the National Bolshevik leader was forceful with our Chairman who was later escorted out of the building by armed guards. The last words uttered by Eduard Limonov were supposedly 'I'm sorry sir, it's time for you to leave'. These words are especially significant as the two politicians were known to have a lasting relationship, with the National Bolshevik leader supposedly guiding Rutskoy to the Eurasian movement."

Now as David Duke is stranded with various Governors, the General declared himself head of a military junta aimed at restoring order to the streets of America. The question is, can he do it?"

Now is the time for the junta to truly seize power..."

According to certain journalists and polls conducted in various regions of America, there is a new cult with rapidly rising popularity. This cult claims that all Presidents since George Washington have failed to truly preserve the values of the founding fathers, and hence it is only right for his descendants to take control once again. While there are thousands with connections to the first President, historians have confirmed that businessman Paul Emery Washington would be the most likely heir to George's position. If this cult of personality grows even more popular, the junta could be facing serious opposition..."

 usa.108.d:0 "With this unusual cult of personality growing more popular by the day, as media across the nation reports on it, the government has personally consulted Paul Emery. According to President Milley, if the majority of Americans support Paul's ascension to power, he will oblige and dissolve his own Junta. After an apparently tense meeting with the businessman, it was decided by Paul that he would satisfy the needs of the people and assume control over our Republic. But now as President Milley steps down and his military colleagues return to the lives of commanders, everyone is asking one question. Can American monarchism work?"

The government has been hindered by CIA leaks and apparently the monarch has grown frustrated with this lack of cooperation. To resolve this pressing issue, Paul decided to immediately fire the Director along with all those who have expressed contempt for his rule.

The ending of this speech made by newly inaugurated PM Barack Obama was met with thunderous applause from the millions standing below. As the first black American head of government, his election did cause a significant amount of controversy, but it seems the majority of Americans are completely behind their charismatic leader.

While many have supported a strongman authoritarian government with Duke at the helm, it seems the President has other plans. According to his statement, he is working tirelessly to bringing back jobs and the upper classes back to America, in order to stimulate our economy.

As expected the debate lasted hardly an hour, as the conglomerate of businessmen and corporate leaders came to the conclusion that this act would be beneficial for all Americans.

While some declined and chose to remain in Canada, Mexico or any other country they fled to in 1987, there were already planes arriving in Atlanta. With the President on the tarmac, these CEOs and businesspeople were greeted with the cheers of thousands along the fenceline, eagerly waiting for their 'saviors'."

Their question was answered today when Congress passed a bill which transformed the position of President into one of a figurehead head of state. He now no longer has any power over what laws the body passes and can not appoint his own cabinet secretaries. This is a major blow to Duke and his National Renewal Party, who were seemingly hoping to work cohesively with Congress instead of being sidelined."

Some have even proposed handing Congress to the Klan itself in order to avoid a violent confrontation. This issue, which brought the two old friends together, resulted in a conversation spanning almost an entire day until the fateful decision was made. In one of his few national addresses President Duke announced he would be stepping aside in favour of Ancona, but would maintain his position as President of the National Renewal Party.

However, there is a supposedly internationalist faction within our government that is pushing for anti-Soviet policies, and more alignment within a socialist 'African Union'. If this inward factional divide continues, Ethiopia will never have a strong foreign policy for the next few years."

Even Emperor Haile Selassie I pushed for gradual land reforms across the nation, but they spectacularly failed, resulting in a famine that made the world think Ethiopia was simply another backwater nation. But if we are truly ready to assert ourselves and develop the entire nation, this Shengo must decide as soon as possible on how to deal with possible land reforms."

 ethiopia.6.d:0 "At the conclusion of the 2010 Workers Party Convention, the anti-Soviet 'internationalist' faction has gained significant support from both within the Shengo and throughout Ethiopia.

Since their outstanding collapse in the face of President Mengistu's 1990s betrayal, this faction has been looking for new ways to get their revenge. And now, it seems in hotly contested Convention debates, they have shown their spectacular skills of bringing sceptics to another point of view. Now President Desalegn faces an unpredictable cabinet full of defectors, as well as an empowered and rebellious military."

 ethiopia.8.d:0 "At the official conclusion of the 2010 Workers Party Convention, no faction has been seen to gain any significant support from both within the Shengo and throughout Ethiopia. After debating the issue of land reform, a verbal battle between too members quickly turned into an outstanding brawl between all in the Shengo. Many walked out and announced their resignations in the face of a bewildered President Desalegn, and some even called for the dissolution of this administrative body. Many had expected this to still be a relatively calm Convention as all others have been, but for some reason 2010 has brought issues dear to many Ethiopian politicians into a violent arena. With half of the President's cabinet resigning and the military seemingly poised to launch a coup against the 'rebellious government', Ethiopia has reached a breaking point."

As some in the international media have reported, he believes that Ethiopia is rapidly approaching a famine of the likes we haven't seen since the reign of Emperor Selassie. While currently there aren't any visible signs of this possible disaster, the minister warned that this government must go through the motions of preventing such a catastrophe before it's too late. The question is, should we spend our precious time working towards preventing something that may never actually occur, or move on with other initiatives?"

 ethiopia.10.d:0 "Regional governors from the rural North and South wrote a report detailing a worrying development in their respective jurisdictions. According to this report, hundreds of Ethiopians are facing a deadly lack of food and some other resources, and even more thousands are noticing some discrepancies.

 ethiopia.11.t:0 "World Media Speculates"
 ethiopia.11.d:0 "Unfortunately the international media is beginning to catch on that there may be something significant occurring in Ethiopia. According to the latest BBC, CNN and other network reports, this nation is approaching a famine that will 'completely devastate' our way of life for decades to come. Their fearmongering has even suggested that the disaster will spread to other regions of East Africa, in particular Somalia and Sudan.

 ethiopia.13.t:0 "Food Shortages Reported"
 ethiopia.13.d:0 "While some irregular reports of lack of food in certain rural provinces were becoming more apparent a few months ago, there is now even more worrying news. As of now, every single rural region of Ethiopia is reporting that they are experiencing food shortages.

 ethiopia.14.d:0 "In an unprecedented move directly violating [Root.GetLeader]'s orders, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas has declared a crisis across Ethiopia. With families starving and children dying for the world to see, they state that a famine is now occurring, one unlike any other. International media watches on as poor Ethiopians scramble to save what they can, and rations are handed out in certain more wealthier areas. But for most of this nation's populace, this could be the end..."
 ethiopia.14.o1:0 "Definitely not ideal"
 ethiopia.15.t:0 "Famine Ends"
 ethiopia.15.d:0 "Almost two years since the official beginning of Ethiopia's disastrous famine, it seems that the worst is over. Rural regions are reporting significant harvests and families are finally able to get the food they so greatly needed. But as we look upon the last two years, one has to wonder why the government failed to respond quickly and effectively to a looming crisis, that even non-Ethiopians could see coming."
 ethiopia.15.o1:0 "Finally"
 ethiopia.16.t:0 "Ethiopia Offers Integration"
 ethiopia.16.d:0 "The post-Desalegn government of Ethiopia is known for its internationalist perspective on socialism and Africa itself. They seem to believe that all Africans must be united under one red banner, but of course with some elements of Ethiopian political dominance. This is most likely why their President just made an intriguing and controversial proposal. According to him, it would be beneficial for both Ethiopia and Somalia to unite as one, allowing their stronger and more centralised government to develop Somalia as it was intended. Some radicals within our government have announced their support for such a move, but hardline conservatives and nationalists despise it."
 ethiopia.16.o1:0 "Accept"
 ethiopia.16.o2:0 "Refuse"
 ethiopia.17.t:0 "Somalia Accepts"
 ethiopia.17.d:0 "Our generous and humanist offer has just been accepted by the Somalian government, with the full support of President [SOM.GetLeader]. While we did expect backlash from within his relatively conservative and nationalist cabinet, it seems the process has gone through quite smoothly within Somalia. Now we simply have to wait for all the necessary treaties to be signed and the official dissolution of the SOmalian nation state to take place."
 ethiopia.17.o1:0 "Excellent"
 ethiopia.18.t:0 "Somalia Refuses"
 ethiopia.18.d:0 "Our generous and humanist offer has just been rejected by the Somalian government, with President [SOM.GetLeader] and his hardline nationalist cabinet voicing their anger at such a 'disgraceful' suggestion. For now it seems the Somalians can't see any benefits in African socialist unification, so we will have to do this the hard way."

 ethiopia.19.t:0 "Ethiopia in the Warsaw Pact?"
 ethiopia.19.d:0 "After securing a loyal National Shengo in the recent Workers Party Convention, President Desalegn has made it clear to his people that he will push for full membership within the Warsaw Pact. While we currently only admit European nations as full members, with other socialist brothers remaining observer states, this could be the next great leap for our world order. The question remains however... will Ethiopia be a blessing or a burden for our strong alliance?"

 ethiopia.20.t:0 "Soviets Accept"
 ethiopia.20.d:0 "Ethiopians observed eagerly on their television sets as the Soviet Politburo debated our nation's possible membership in the Warsaw Pact. On one side, nationalists and self-proclaimed European Communists stated that Ethiopia would be a burden on the strong alliance. On the other hand, friendlier and more welcoming Soviet politicians declared that the socialist world order would eventually collapse if it didn't allow other developing nations into its open arms.

Rebellious soldiers commanded by the notoriously anti-government Commander Ismail Mahmut Alash stormed the President's Palace, arresting key members of his administration and loyal Palace Guards. In other areas of Djibouti City, the underground Communist Party mobilised to secure the streets and urge the people of Djibouti to revolt against their 'capitalist oppressors'. As of now, with supporters of [Root.GetLeader] fightings against the conspirators and fellow citizens, this nation stands at a crossroads. Could the loyal members of our army once again seize the advantage, or will the coup succeed and condemn our President to a life in exile?"

 ethiopia.24.d:0 "The people of Ethiopia have spoken! As the results are coming in across our great country, it is clear that a major monarchist victory, especially in rural areas, will secure a restoration of the House of Solomon in the near future.

A few weeks ago President [Root.GetLeader] announced that the relatively short election campaign had begun and today was the day Ethiopians truly decided their future. However, some international observers have stated that this short campaign and the transitional government's total control over all branches of our society, could lead to a rigged election.

This Union shall ensure that the continent eventually has a common currency, defence, foreign policy, courts and many other branches of administration. Member states will work closely together and coordinate efforts to spread the revolution across Africa and at some point, the world. However, vocal nationalists within our nation have stated that this would bring an end to our independence and everything we should be standing for. So the question is... do we really stand for independence, or a world of socialism?"
 ethiopia.27.o1:0 "We will join"
 ethiopia.27.o2:0 "We choose independence!"
 ethiopia.28.t:0 "The African Dollar"
 ethiopia.28.d:0 "The first of [ETH.GetLeader]'s proposals, a common currency for the African Union, will supposedly strengthen our economies and allow trade to flourish between the socialist systems of each member state. While we have remained isolated from certain countries due to our political and economic system, this could be a perfect opportunity to no longer rely on our seemingly failing self-sufficiency. However, it would also mean that more of our trade and revenue is devoted to the African Union, a prospect that many are afraid will once again damage our independence."
 ethiopia.28.o1:0 "An excellent proposal"

 ethiopia.29.t:0 "African Supreme Court"
 ethiopia.29.d:0 "Another controversial proposal from the government of [ETH.GetLeader] is that of a common Supreme Court for the entire African Union. This will overhaul all member states' judicial systems, placing the African Court as the highest law of the land. Supporters of this move in our nation state that this will ensure we remain true to the socialist cause and that no renegade dictators attempt to seize power. Opponents on the other hand believe that President [ETH.GetLeader] is trying to hasten Ethiopia's supposed 'peaceful conquest' of the African continent. Conspiracy theories aside, this is a genuine fear amongst the population that we must address before making our decision."

This proposal, titled the 'Continental Self-Defence and Protection Treaty', will unite all armies of signatory states and create one united African Army. The Chairman of the African Union will have almost total control over this new military body and Presidents of each nation will be sidelined when it comes to military matters. Unlike the African Dollar and Supreme Court, this proposal could easily be used to further Ethiopia's goals within our nation.

If we refuse, our country lives to see another sunrise but we shall be expelled from the Union and face bitter retaliation from its loyal members.

But now apparently President Desalegn no longer cares about 'public outcry' as he recently ordered several construction teams to overrun the Chapel, and if nothing was found, destroy it.

The crop grown during this period is typically planted in March or April, when the first rains of the year fall. In 2011, the rains were late, falling in late April and May, and inadequate. The crops were planted late and are only now being harvested. In southern Somalia, currently the most severely impacted region, the harvest is expected to be 50 percent below average, says the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).

Both were near Ethiopia on the Horn of Africa and both were impoverished. Italy sought to improve its position in Africa by conquering Ethiopia and joining it with its two territories. Menelik II was the Ethiopian leader who pitted Italy against its European rivals while stockpiling weapons to defend Ethiopia against the Italians."

 ethiopia.51.d:0 "Originally thought to be from around the 11th century, new carbon dating techniques place the Garima Gospels between 330 and 650 AD. The 1,600 year-old texts are named after a monk, Abba Garima, who arrived in Ethiopia in the fifth century. According to legend, he copied out the Gospels in just one day after founding the Garima Monastery, near Adwa in the north of the country. The Garima Gospels, which are believed to have magical powers, have never left the monastery. They were written on goat skin in the early Ethiopian language of Ge'ez and are thought to be the earliest example of book binding still attached to the original pages."

Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the Second Coming of Christ. Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognised the inner divinity within every individual. Rastafari is Afrocentric and focuses its attention on the African diaspora, which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or Babylon. Many Rastas call for the resettlement of the African diaspora in either Ethiopia or Africa more widely, referring to this continent as the Promised Land of Zion. Today the Emperor called for all Ethiopians to observe his first national address from the Imperial Palace.

According to the latest BBC, CNN and other network reports, the country is approaching a famine that will 'completely devastate' Ethiopia's way of life for decades to come. Reports have even suggested that the disaster will spread to other regions of East Africa, in particular Somalia and Sudan. While some believe the media has blown this situation out of proportion, perhaps the Ethiopian government should be enacting some kinds of reform to combat such an event."

With the service in fact more than a hundred metres away from the pair, it became clear to them that the two most powerful politicians in Britain could be the targets of a possible assassination. The dispatch proceeded to run towards Owen and Williams, but they were too late. A camouflaged figure took two shots. One hit the Prime Minister and the second barely missed Deputy PM Williams, piercing the hill just behind her. Before anyone could come to their senses, the assassin had disappeared, and Owen lay motionless at Shirley Williams' feet. To the horror of all British citizens, Royal London Hospital declared this afternoon that their beloved long-time leader had passed away."

The British government has supposedly been preparing for this moment for many weeks now, refining every clause of the deal and ensuring Britain is a worthy member of our alliance. The Politburo has discussed this deal and unanimously decided to allow Britain's socialist republic into the Warsaw Pact, simply waiting for the Chairman to ratify their decision."
 britain.46.o1:0 "Welcome!"
 britain.47.t:0 "Britain Joins Us"
 britain.47.d:0 "The glorious British people have finally chosen the path of Maoism, empowering the peasantry and crushing the imperialists. Now London's government officially extended an olive branch to Beijing with a very interesting announcement. The National British Political Bureau has come to the conclusion that their nation and ours would be greatly benefited by an official military, economic and political alliance, stretching from the Atlantic to Pacific Oceans. However, it is of course still up to us, as to whether this alliance will come into effect. So Mr. Chairman, do we accept or politely refuse their olive branch?"
 britain.47.o1:0 "Accept"
 britain.47.o2:0 "Refuse"
 britain.48.t:0 "China Refuses"
 britain.48.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Chinese government has rejected our harmonious proposal for an alliance of Maoist nations, stretching from the Atlantic to Pacific Oceans. This military pact could have secured a red world led by China and Britain for the next century, but for some unknown reason the Chinese government decided to politely refuse. It seems for now Britain stands alone in a looming Soviet world order."
 britain.48.o1:0 "Very disappointing"
 britain.49.t:0 "Commonwealth of Nations"
 britain.49.d:0 "It has been decades since the dissolution of the Commonwealth of Nations, labelled by some as a secure alliance of friendly countries, and by others as a proto-imperialist dictatorship. But in these past few decades, many in former Commonwealth nations have begun to see the benefits of their old organisation. Even as the Soviets established a world order of socialism, they remained relatively stable under the guidance of the United Kingdom's democratic leadership, and despite what the radicals might have said, there was little tyranny to be seen. The time has now come for us to decide who we agree with. As the British government proclaims the official reformation of the Commonwealth, this administration shall decide whether our people will once again return to their imperial Roots... or should [Root.GetName] stay truly independent in the coming years."
 britain.49.o1:0 "Stable with Britain!"

They even went so far as to say the Commonwealth could be integrated further as a military alliance, albeit such a move would be a long way off. For now however, we can rejoice knowing that this nation truly believes in Britain's legacy across our world."

 britain.51.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has rejected our call for a reformed Commonwealth of Nations, stating that this democratic organisation will fail to ensure a stable world of freedom, liberty and capitalism.

 britain.51.o1:0 "Their loss"
 britain.52.t:0 "Commonwealth Alliance"
 britain.52.d:0 "Our membership within the restored Commonwealth of Nations has drawn sharp criticism from many, claiming that the organisation has no power and is simply an attempt at restoring Britain's pride and natural imperialist nature. However, in the short time as a member state we have achieved far greater relations with the world's democracies than ever before, especially with the British. Sooner than expected, London has called for greater integration of the Commonwealth, with the Prime Minister announcing this morning that it will officially become a political and military alliance between nations. It is still up to us however, as to if we join the alliance... or remain neutral."
 britain.52.o1:0 "We will join"

This call was met with joyous celebration on both sides of the issue, as for decades the Coalition of Irish Voices has rejected any form of national vote. As the day has finally come, will the people of Ulster align with the British, Irish or an independent Ulster?"

As the results came in, we expected a close race between Republicans and Unionists, but no one thought the independent Ulster vote would attract such a significant portion of the population. So significant in fact, that it has taken the lead over Irish or British unification.

 britain.59.d:0 "Offshore oil drilling has been a regular sight in the seas off Scotland's coast, as corporations invest all they can in the rich resources below. However, the actual volume of this resource drilled is dropping due to the miserable economic situation. Operations move to the Middle East and workers are constantly removed from their positions to find another job. It seems the government's solution to this worrying issue, was to directly invest state funding into expanded drilling operations, bringing back thousands of workers to the industry. [Root.GetLeader]'s announcement this morning stated that there would be significantly more offshore drilling, which shall supposedly become apparent in the next few months."

 britain.60.d:0 "Since her dissolution of Parliament and establishment of absolute control for Her Majesty, she has still not officially become the autocrat she obviously intends to be. Today however, the de facto has become de jure, with Britain's provisional government officially stating Parliament is no more and Her Majesty shall rule unopposed by the 'traitorous republicans'. Obviously this was never a shock to the British people, and many are still going about their daily lives, some being more apolitical than ever in these interesting times. Perhaps Queen Elizabeth II really can rule without anyone trying to bring her down."

 britain.61.t:0 "New Powers for the House of Lords"
 britain.61.d:0 "Sweeping new powers for Britain's upper house, the House of Lords, were declared late in the afternoon by Prince Philip. While the Queen was on holiday in Wales, the Prince gathered the support of various Barons to enact reform allowing these powers. Now the House can dictate national and foreign policy, with the approval of Her Majesty of course. Finally the remnants of the old House of Commons have been swept away, at least until we restore the lower house."
 britain.61.o1:0 "Good for them"
 britain.62.t:0 "British Security Act"
 britain.62.d:0 "Today the House of Lords passed the much-anticipated British Security act, followed by an excellent speech from the Queen herself. 'With my gracious royal approval, the British Security Act shall go down in history as the greatest enforcement of law, order and safety in the entire world. Now the people of Britain can finally know they are secure in their own homes, and that enemies of the state shall no longer remain hidden from my government. On such a joyous day I thank all those of the upper house in their swift passing of the BSA, and hope we can continue to keep this glorious country safe from foreign intrusion'. Celebrated by some as a great victory for the Queen's supposedly holy new order, and despised by many due to its 'totalitarian ideals', the Act will surely create a rift in our society. But of course, all those who oppose it won't be hidden this time."
 britain.62.o1:0 "Britain is safe again"
 britain.63.t:0 "Social Democrats Pledge Support"
 britain.63.d:0 "Social Democratic Party leader Shirley Williams has pledged her outright support for Her Majesty's administration, and in particular her recent controversial coup against an elected Parliament. Disappointing various radicals that had wished for her to rise up against the Queen, Williams made this announcement on the grounds of Parliament, on a bright day many haven't seen in weeks. Finally the issue of SDP republicanism can be put to rest, knowing that their paramount leader is completely behind Elizabeth II."
 britain.63.o1:0 "Excellent"
 britain.64.t:0 "Conservative Party Pledges Support"
 britain.64.d:0 "Experiencing a leadership contest, the Conservative Party decided it was best for the Deputy to make a very special announcement to Britain's media. Nigel Farage called his journalist allies and opponents to Conservative HQ, officially declaring and signing a document that states his Party is completely behind Queen Elizabeth II. The document also stated that Her Majesty's coup was perfectly understandable and justified against a failing Parliament, making the Conservatives the new laughing stock of Britain. More or less however, the Queen shouldn't be seeing any true opposition from the Tories any time soon."
 britain.64.o1:0 "Excellent"
 britain.65.t:0 "Queen and Far Right Meet"
 britain.65.d:0 "Elite members of the far right parties Britain First, British National Party and others, met with Her Majesty this morning for an official state breakfast. While the media weren't permitted inside once the meeting began, it is clear they were discussing some kind of deal with the head of state. This deal could put far right parties at the forefront of British politics for the coming decades, taking over more moderate political positions from the center. Returning home, BNP leader Nick Griffin could only say the meeting was productive and helped him clear up various policy positions with the Queen."
 britain.65.o1:0 "Interesting"
 britain.66.t:0 "Parliament Resumes Operations"
 britain.66.d:0 "Britain's supposed 'puppet' House of Commons has been permitted to officially resume operations by order of the Queen. Critics label the lower house as a puppet of Elizabeth because it is only made up of allied staunchly monarchist parties, and leftists that threatened a conservative government in earlier elections were not allowed back. Supporters of the move instead state that leftists were damaging our democracy, and the Queen has finally restored a true society of freedom in Britain."

 britain.68.d:0 "Leader of the factional Independent Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has dramatically expressed his outrage at the Queen. Holding a rally on the outskirts of London and drawing thousands, the radical leftist declared the banning of this party is a slap in democracy's face. He event went so far as to say Britain is no longer free, and the Queen can no longer be stopped on her 'tyrannical path'. Of course however, he is simply a delusional leftist loon, and by now the Queen has probably realised she doesn't need to pay attention to him."
 britain.68.o1:0 "Screw the leftists"
 britain.69.t:0 "Republicans Purged"
 britain.69.d:0 "Republicans like Labour member Dennis Skinner have been trying to ruin our constitutional monarchy for countless decades, declaring the monarchy a 'useless institution'. Now with the Queen having boundless power over her subjects, she has finally been able to purge these horrid beings, announcing this morning that all republicans shall be hunted down and arrested for their treachery against the British people. Cheers from monarchists and outrage from republicans are obvious, but the latter group are the only ones who need to be worried."

 britain.70.t:0 "British People Support Parliament"
 britain.70.d:0 "Since the Queen's highly controversial attempted coup against Parliament, the British people have voiced their jubilant support for elected government. After being humiliated by Members and taken out of the building, Her Majesty has unleashed a tirade of insults against Parliament, stating that the body has failed to protect Britain's people and even its Prime Minister. But these words have simply been laughed at by the very mentioned British people, bringing Elizabeth II's popularity to an all time low. Now a polarising political figure, it is clear that Britain still believes their precious House of Commons can push through this hard time of significant geopolitical change."
 britain.70.o1:0 "Ok"
 britain.71.t:0 "Radical Parties Influence Corbyn"
 britain.71.d:0 "During the election, Jeremy Corbyn's Independent Labour Party was labelled by many on the right as communist and dangerously pro-EU. Despite this however, Corbyn caused the greatest upset in British political history by taking power with a party he had only just revitalised and reformed. Conservatives, Labour and the Social Democrats were blown away when the ILP remained at the top of all polls, remaining so as Corbyn met with Her Majesty to form a government in her humiliated name. But now the cracks are beginning to show, and it appears conservatives could have been right about the dangerous communist influence in Corbyn's political organisation. Leaked reports from his headquarters have led many to believe that radical factions are attempting to influence their leader, pushing for a more hardline leftist approach on all issues. For now democracy shall still prevail over totalitarian leftism..."
 britain.71.o1:0 "Interesting developments"
 britain.72.t:0 "Trade Union Treachery"
 britain.72.d:0 "Both the Labour and Independent Labour parties have obviously always been aligned closely with trade unions across Britain. In these many years of union ties, British political society has never seen treachery quite this big. Reports are flying in from various independent sources implying that trade unions are intentionally going behind the Prime Minister's back to establish themselves as paramount leaders of the United Kingdom. Such startling revelations have apparently created a worrying rift between cabinet, Corbyn and union leaders, who are all trying to one-up the other in a ridiculous political game."
 britain.72.o1:0 "Perhaps Corbyn will have to resign"
 britain.73.t:0 "Surge in Communist Support"
 britain.73.d:0 "It was expected by various political analysts and even everyday Britons, that the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister would virtually crush the Communist voice. But now it seems they are more vocal than ever, even claiming Corbyn is still a traitorous capitalist and not a true socialist as they are. While these statements could be seen as the ramblings of a politically destroyed movement, the polls are showing the complete opposite. Support for the Communist Party of Great Britain is rising rapidly and many in the Independent Labour Party are worried they might try something stupid in the coming weeks or months."
 britain.73.o1:0 "Surely not"
 britain.74.t:0 "Government Announces Increased Police Presence"
 britain.74.d:0 "According to the Home Secretary, countless cities and towns across the United Kingdom will be seeing an increased police presence, directly funded by a grand initiative from London's government. This drastic increase is expected to fight against crime in urban areas, and some conspiracy theorists believe this is an attempt at establishing ruthless order in less cooperative neighbourhoods."
 britain.74.o1:0 "Ok"
 britain.75.t:0 "Government Announces New Tax Plan"
 britain.75.d:0 "The egotistically-named 'Great Conservative Tax Plan' will lower the tax rate in Britain by 5%, according to the Prime Minister. Such a decrease is viewed by statists and especially the Labour Party as having a disastrous impact on the stagnated British economy, but it seems Conservatives simply don't care. The tax plan will go into effect in the next few weeks, and still most Britons are joyous at the news of having a bit more cash in their pockets. The question is, will it really fix the economy?"
 britain.75.o1:0 "Ok"

 britain.76.d:0 "'Britain can never be strong without a powerful and threatening military to defend it against all threats, foreign and domestic. My government's initiative will ensure that the people of this great country can feel safe knowing that their troops are fighting for freedom, liberty and security.'

 britain.76.o1:0 "Ok"
 britain.77.t:0 "New Economic Plan Announced"
 britain.77.d:0 "Consistently labelled a centrist political party, the Liberal Democrats in power are prepared to take economic principles from both the left and right to form their national plan. This is evident in the new economic plan they have devised, even themselves stating it is a mix of the left and right, taking only the good and none of the disadvantages. Only time will tell however, as to if this will fix the British economy in the long run."
 britain.77.o1:0 "Ok"
 britain.78.t:0 "Government Announces Decreased Corporate Taxes"
 britain.78.d:0 "While relatively populist in the last election, the Liberal Democrats have maintained a pro-business stance in recent years, declaring their official economic policy a great boost for both small and large companies. Today however, we have seen the true mathematical impact Liberal Democrat governance is going to have on our business owners. By decreasing the company tax rate by 10%, [Root.GetLeader] hopes to develop the economy and promote competition between various corporations."
 britain.78.o1:0 "Ok"
 britain.79.t:0 "More Direct Democracy"
 britain.79.d:0 "British democracy is deeply flawed and biased towards major establishment parties, notably the Conservatives and Social Democrats. This is apparently why the Liberal Democratic government has decided to push for new reforms, which will promote direct democracy and greater participation of the British people. Soon they will be able to vote on the passing of laws or budgetary decisions, like the citizens of Switzerland. An initiative despised by more radical right and left wing parties, even establishment figures have voiced their support for [Root.GetLeader]'s move."
 britain.79.o1:0 "Ok"
 britain.80.t:0 "'Trotskyist' Labour Condemned"
 britain.80.d:0 "In an attempt to further legitimise the strength of the PM's Social Democratic Party, [Root.GetLeader] has openly labelled Labour as trotskyist and damaging to British politics. Such accusations were only apparent during the first Labour-SDP split decades ago, but since then the two parties have maintained a relatively cordial relationship, with the former even forming coalitions with a senior Social Democratic partner. But now that relationship has been crushed, and many Britons are truly convinced that the Labour party is seeking to establish a Trotskyist state on their precious home soil."

 britain.81.t:0 "Statue of David Owen Erected"
 britain.81.d:0 "Tragically deceased Prime Minister David Owen was loved by countless Britons as a stabilising force in troubling times. He held this nation together through the collapse of Western democracy and capitalism as we knew it, the peaceful transfer of Hong Kong and possibility of war with the Warsaw Pact. Now his legacy is even greater, with the current Social Democratic government announcing that they shall be erecting a statue of their former leader outside the Houses of Parliament. Alongside Winston Churchill's statue, Owen shall represent the greatness of Britain in the past 20 years and how despite all this hardship, the people managed to pull through and unite far greater than ever before. He will certainly be remembered as one of the greatest British Prime Ministers to have ever led us."

This budget details a grand expansion of our nuclear arsenal, from submarines to ICBMs and various bomber aircraft. The Secretary denied reports that Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader]'s administration is preparing for war with a nation such as the Soviet Union, stating instead that this expansion will be vital to securing Britain against all foreign threats, not just the communist menace. Progressives are sceptical but many on the center and center right are praising this expansion."

 britain.83.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader]'s government was in talks with unions and other stakeholders just a few weeks ago, to discuss undisclosed topics. However, almost all analysts suspected this was about Labour's upcoming national welfare overhaul. And today they were proven right, with the Prime Minister calling for an urgent gathering of journalists outside 10 Downing Street. In [Root.GetLeader]'s subsequent announcement, an overhaul of the healthcare system, maternity leave scheme and other controversial issues were detailed, leaving many conservatives and libertarians furious at their supposedly moderate government."

 britain.85.t:0 "Economic Advisory Council"
 britain.85.d:0 "Britain's economic situation has certainly not been desirable for these past 20 years, although admittedly Prime Minister Owen's popularity ratings remained unbelievably high. Factories remained abandoned, infrastructure rotted away in any areas other than London and the stock market gradually dropped to its lowest point in five decades. Fortunately, the Labour government has an interesting initiative that will supposedly save our country from an even greater financial collapse. The Economic Advisory Council will aid Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader]'s cabinet in creating budgets and constructing new projects. Its goal at the moment is to decrease unemployment by 3.5% within the next two years, a feat seen by many as impossible, and by others a wonderful target for their elected representatives."

 britain.86.d:0 "While the pre-referendum polls were showing a relatively close race between the monarchist and republican votes, our camp already noticed a drastic shift in public opinion when the first results started to come in. An overwhelming number of republican votes from Scotland and Wales showcased to the Queen her new-found irrelevance in those regions, but the greatest shock came in England. Besides various rural areas, even England voted overwhelmingly by almost more than 10% to abolish the monarchy. Monarchists began to realise their side was doomed, but the republican majority celebrated all throughout the night until Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] officially announced they had won the referendum. Now the Queen is reportedly preparing to leave Windsor Palace to become an ordinary British citizen, and the PM has already signed all documents establishing a Republic within our isles."

 britain.87.t:0 "Corbyn's National Health Service"
 britain.87.d:0 "As leader of the Independent Labour Party for many years now, Jeremy Corbyn used his time to draft an extensive revitalised National Health Service. This universal healthcare system would restore many aspects of the former pre-Howe welfare state and bring proper treatment to all Britons, no matter what income bracket they adhered to. Today Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] declared the official establishment of ILP's NHS, going into effect almost immediately as its passing through the House of Commons was swift and efficient."

 britain.88.t:0 "Conservatives Denounce Prime Minister"
 britain.88.d:0 "Members of the Conservative Party and various allies throughout the political spectrum have voiced their significant discontent with recent developments. Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader]'s visit to Berlin, Paris and Rome aimed to improve relations with the once hostile European Union members, as well as establish new trade links with our former enemies. However, the visit has been met with backlash that the government simply must have expected from a populace quite terrified of communists, at least since the assassination of David Owen. But if [Root.GetLeader] can get through this storm of right wing outrage, the administration should also be able to finalise the deals discussed in mainland Europe."

 britain.89.d:0 "After the Conservative Party's historic victory in our recent snap election, polls are beginning to show a surge in support for other right wing parties, even for the far right anti-establishment organisations like Britain First and the National Party. Nick Griffin himself addressed this interesting trend, stating to several journalists that the people of Britain are ready for radical national change, not just in the Houses of Parliament but across all levels of government. Only time will tell however, as to whether this trend will continue until the next general election."

 britain.90.t:0 "National Health Service Privatised"
 britain.90.d:0 "One of the Conservative Party's greatest promises was to maintain the current National Health Service, deemed by many on the left as an abomination compared to its original predecessor of the same name. However, even the Tories have broken their promise in shocking fashion. Outside 10 Downing Street [Root.GetLeader] declared the total and immediate privatisation of Britain's NHS, stating that 'this country's welfare society must come to an end as quickly as possible'. Privatisation will leave many Britons wondering what to do next, as they fail to afford vital surgeries and other medical procedures. And in a political sense, these are certainly dark times for the left."

 britain.91.t:0 "Conservative Leadership Election"
 britain.91.d:0 "Early this morning the Prime Minister was called to Conservative Party headquarters to announce a new leadership election, putting himself on the chopping block in the face of significant criticism from many within his own party. As polls slump drastically, and far right politicians continue to flock from the Conservatives to BNP and Britain First, the party was left wondering what to do next. Now as this mysterious leadership election comes to an end, the British people have a new Prime Minister. Former Deputy PM Nigel Farage will take charge as the leader of our United Kingdom, meeting with the Queen in the coming hours to form a government in her name."

Terrifying black smoke rose up above the Houses of Parliament as men, women and children ran in every direction screaming. Limbs were missing, blood covered the streets and bridges, and it soon became apparent that not just Parliament had been attacked. Explosions rocked the district, with the 'grand finale' brutally slaughtering hundreds outside Buckingham Palace. As the smoke cleared and the bodies were cold, it truly seemed like Britain was once again at war with a ruthless evil without any care for human life. Before Prime Minister Farage could prepare an address to the entire nation, Theresa Brasier herself made her way into the mess that was Parliament's most sacred structures. In her signature black and red dress, the Phoenix Front leader gathered thousands of suffering Londoners to hear her fiery speech. 'If the Communist menace can not just murder our Prime Minister, but slaughter without remorse hundreds of innocent Britons, then are we truly safe? Are our children truly safe? Is this country truly safe? The party I once stood proud for has failed to defend us against radical fundamentalists who threaten our very way of life. This is why I now demand Prime Minister Farage hold a general election, and let the British people decide who can protect them from terrorism'. The cheers could be heard throughout London, still before the incompetent government could formulate a response to this horrific attack."

But it seems the monarch and head of government have struck a deal, with the latter announcing today that he has the full support of cabinet in pledging total loyalty to the only supreme leader of Britain... the Queen.

And it seems the monarch and head of government have been unable to strike a deal, with the latter announcing today that he has the full support of cabinet in proclaiming a British Republic.

Immigrants hoping to start a new life in our country have been turned away before they even set foot on this soil, being forced to remain in their country of origin. Those already in Britain have been sent back and the international community is outraged. But countless Britons have declared their support for this policy, stating these are the kind of radical measures they voted for in recent elections."

 britain.98.d:0 "Theresa Brasier's administration has seen an unprecedented surge in support since the fresh general election, unlike other governments which failed to maintain the trend. This post-election growth has further legitimised Brasier's radical proposed measures, which some call tyrannical and others say are necessary for the safety of Britain. Even former Prime Minister Nigel Farage commented that this has been a remarkable turn of events, and he is eager to work with his successor in any endeavour she pursues."
 britain.98.o1:0 "Wonderful"
 britain.99.t:0 "Historic Deal"
 britain.99.d:0 "A historic deal has been agreed upon by Theresa Brasier and various British corporations. Executives attending an exclusive meeting with the High Secretary and her small cabinet discussed a range of issues, from tax rates to international trade. Eventually, the two parties signed a document which stated that all corporations in attendance would pledge their total and unwavering support for Britain's government, in exchange for certain monetary benefits. Leftists are certainly going to label this deal as a huge step towards fascistic corporatism, but their voices won't be heard by mainstream Britain."

 britain.100.d:0 "Officially titled 'Secure Rehabilitation Centres', disguised concentration camps are now being set up throughout the country. From Scotland to the Southern English coast, these camps will keep homosexuals, Arabs, non-Christians and other undesirables away from the purest of Britain, who only want to live a healthy life amongst their fellow white Britons. While Phoenix Front has failed to describe what operations will take place inside Centres, many secretly suspect this is directly akin to the camps of Nazi Germany, but are too afraid to say it aloud."

 britain.101.d:0 "Our Secure Rehabilitation Centres are receiving an unprecedented influx of a new demographic. Radical leftist activists such as Jeremy Corbyn and those amongst the general populace, have been hauled away in vans to undisclosed camps throughout Britain. There they will face the same punishments as other undesirables, all due to their treacherous beliefs that go against everything this nation... this party stands for. Soon there won't even be mention of leftism within Britain..."

 britain.102.d:0 "Highly anticipated program Phoenix Television has been launched with a grand ceremony in London. In front of hundreds of elite guests, Theresa Brasier announced that her predecessor Nigel Farage will be the sole presenter of PT, set to become the only service in Britain within just a few months. Standing alongside her, Farage graciously accepted the invitation and declared a new age of British television had begun, with Phoenix Front leading the way in truth and transparency."

 britain.103.t:0 "No Separation"
 britain.103.d:0 "Separation of church and state has remained a strong foundation of British democracy, with the only real exception being Her Majesty's strong links to the institution. But just a few hours ago the Secretary for Religion announced on national television that this official separation had met its used by date. According to Brasier's loyal cabinet ally, this move will ensure that Britain remains a deeply Christian nation with a devotion to not just God, but the state alongside him. Without this separation, then surely the lines between Theresa Brasier and the Archbishop for example, will become noticeably blurred..."

 britain.104.t:0 "Church's Unconditional Support"
 britain.104.d:0 "Even without the separation of church and state, the Church of England has still remained relatively opposed to some of High Secretary Brasier's national policies. However, those within the institution were quickly purged by the head of government herself, followed by a joint announcement with the Archbishop. The two powerful leaders declared a holy alliance between Phoenix Front and England's paramount religious institution, placing priests under the direct influence of London."

 britain.105.d:0 "Staunchly monarchist, it was never expected that Theresa Brasier would take radical action against the royal family when in government. However, recent developments suggested that perhaps the High Secretary could use abolition of the monarchy to secure total control over Britain. This growing possibility forced cabinet to finally discuss monarchism and republicanism and develop a unanimous decision. This meeting resulted in Brasier herself meeting Queen Elizabeth II for over two hours. While the details of such a meeting have not been disclosed to Britain's state controlled press, it seems the two agreed a monarchy is the best path for this nation."

For us of pure Briton heart know that the British people belong in their own lands, and all beyond represent degeneracy, impurity, death incarnate. No. If Britain is to survive it must first look inwards and heal itself from decades of disastrous liberalism. This is my message. This is the message of Phoenix Front, and this is the message all British peoples wish to hear. The question is, will you stand side by side and defend our home isles against foreign interference, or will you join the traitors who desire an open Britain?' - High Secretary Theresa Brasier"

 britain.107.d:0 "Her Majesty's simple conference with various executives from around Britain and even other nations has attracted the attention of many journalists. After observing the proceedings they seem to believe the Queen is going down a path of royal corporatism, aligning herself with big businesses in an effort to restore confidence in her struggling economy, as well as secure her place as the supreme ruler of Britain. Time can only tell whether this conference will have a significant effect on both, but we can at least be certain that the Queen is hoping for a positive outcome from her own meeting."

 britain.108.t:0 "Grand Coalition Established"
 britain.108.d:0 "When Queen Elizabeth II solidified her control over the House of Commons as a pseudo-puppet body, it was under the pretence that most parties would be able to return to Parliament. Finally, this has been realised, with the Queen announcing just a few hours ago that the Conservative, Social Democratic and Liberal Democratic parties had established a grand coalition. The goal of this coalition is supposedly to enforce Her Majesty's rule across Britain and legitimise any dictatorial policies she may wish to undertake in her long reign. Unfortunately for leftist parties, they have been excluded not just from the coalition but from any position of power within Parliament. Leaders of Labour and in particular Jeremy Corbyn expressed their outrage at the Queen, declaring the time for a Republic is now. Their voices fell on deaf ears."

This holiday's main intention however was to show to the world that Britain is once again united under a strong leader, and that it will take a much more threatening power to overthrow the Queen. As the day approaches, the people are jubilant and Union Jacks cover every single street corner. In this political contest at least, Elizabeth is winning."

 britain.110.d:0 "In her surprise national address to the United Kingdom, Queen Elizabeth declared the beginning of open discussions with Scotland's regional government. Instead of opting for an Anglo-centric position on the Scotland issue, Her Majesty has chosen diplomacy. In the coming weeks, Scotland's First Minister, the Queen and hundreds of stakeholders within Scottish activist movements shall meet in Glasgow to find a solution. While this solution may not be discovered immediately, expectations are high for the meeting as many Britons believe their Queen can make the right concessions. However, a significant portion of England is outraged at their supposed strong leader, seeing her now as a weak puppet of the regional Welsh and Scottish governments. Whether this is true or not is up to discussion, but for now we must see the great benefits of dialogue between 'warring' parties."

 britain.112.d:0 "The Queen has restored the British monarch's former title of Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, one that has been long lost in the pages of history. Since Ireland's treacherous rebellion against King George V, British monarchs have remained without this glorious full title, settling for Northern Ireland until even that was taken from us by a government supposedly formed in Her name. But now all that is behind us, with Queen Elizabeth II restoring the glory of her once magnificent position. How the world will react to such revanchist news... we're not sure."

 britain.113.d:0 "The title Emperor/Empress of India was used by the British monarchs during the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent from 1876 until 1948, after India had attained independence from the United Kingdom, when for a transitional period the British monarch was also king of the independent dominions of India and Pakistan. After the British East India Company deposed the Mughal Emperor, and after the British government dissolved the EIC in 1874, Queen Victoria was given the title 'Empress of India', followed by her successors with the Emperor title. But since that regrettable transfer of power to the Indian people, Britain's monarch has no longer been given the opulent and grand title of Emperor or Empress. This, Queen Elizabeth said, must change. And that change came into effect at mid-day yesterday, when Her Majesty proclaimed herself Empress of India."

 britain.115.d:0 "Various cabinet ministers gathered together a few hours ago to announce immediate and radical economic reforms, spanning from healthcare to energy and infrastructure to wages. While the specific details of such economic reforms were not described, it has been assumed by most political analysts that these will be in line with the policies of more radical left parties. Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] has recently shown his incompetence in halting radical influences within his Independent Labour Party, and every day he seems to be forced more and more into a corner."

 britain.116.t:0 "Crackdown on Reactionary Media"
 britain.116.d:0 "Britain's reactionary right wing media have established dangerous mindsets within the British populace, making many believe that our socialist policies in fact work against their best interests. This is why the government has officially decided to crack down on fake news within establishment media services, especially Rupert Murdoch's conservative entertainment regime. Soon the only media left in this country will be those telling the truth."

Before the details of this ministry remained a mystery for much of the British populace, but now with the official opening, details are coming out.

However, among others like nationalisation, immigration and defence, the most pressing was the issue of monarchy itself. Apparently, Corbyn stated to Queen Elizabeth that his government was working towards the abolition of royal institutions within the next few months, whether she liked it or not. She would either have to accept the radical reforms and resign, or face a civil war against her now humiliated position. Surprisingly, it appears she has chosen the former, announcing to Britain and the world that once Corbyn's government has finalised all documents and proceedings, she will formally support the removal of herself as Queen."

Leaving Buckingham Palace in the middle of the day now as a commoner, her former majesty faces a daunting new life for the royal family, who have reigned over Britain for centuries. As this occurred, Prime Minister Corbyn was removed from office by the even more radical leftist factions of his Independent Labour Party. Aligned with the Workers' Revolutionary Party, these 'traitors' told Corbyn his days of moderate rule were over, and that new leadership was required to bring the recently proclaimed British Republic into an era of prosperity. Solemnly accepting his depressing fate, the now former PM was arrested by party officials for treason against the British state. We have entered a new socialist era... and the moderates are no more."

The move has been criticised by some within our government and the populace, declaring it an 'invasion' by American elites who will supposedly attempt to conquer our political system. Whatever the conspiracy theorists might believe, the time has come to finally greet our new friends.

These congresses will be the foundation of our new federal system, allowing each regional government to define some of its own laws and other systems, while still remaining dependent nations within the British Republic.

However, it seems [Root.GetLeader] thinks the situation hasn't progressed rapidly enough, calling on all sectors left to be privatised, to be directly nationalised within the coming months. This unprecedented centralisation of our economy could damage us internationally, but will certainly give the government far greater control over production output, as well as restricting work rights for all citizens."

Several members of cabinet left the meeting, commenting that their now former boss had possible gone insane with new-found power. With all opposition within his own administration out of the way, [Root.GetLeader] met with leaders of the military high command to plan rapid liberation of besieged capitalist strongholds, especially in Europe.

This was due to leaked reports that suggested strong Trotskyist elements within the administration were influencing Britain's foreign policy. Eager to counter the press, our head of state oversaw the purging of these elements, and now it seems the worst is over. During the weekly national address on television, [Root.GetLeader] announced the 'socialism through peace' doctrine that will apparently define Britain for the next century. This doctrine supports promotion of leftist parties within democratic nations, and funding rebel groups within terrible autocratic regimes, but at the same time recognising the rights of foreign citizens to vote how they wish.

Eventually with Windsor Palace burning and the army in control of strategic locations, it was concluded by our military high command that the monarchist reactionaries had been captured.

Officially being absorbed by the Communist Party of Great Britain minutes later, new Prime Minister, [Root.GetLeader], ordered his loyal forces to execute the royal family.

Unlike the Soviet Union, it seems a socialist system has worked far more efficiently and prosperously in the People's Republic, which is why our government has decided to emulate it. Instead of establishing a workers' revolution, the Politburo declared a new era for Britain... a Maoist era.

 britain.143.d:0 "Communism has split at different points in history, usually around disasters like the World Wars. Truly the most prominent in our modern era however is Bolshevism... or specifically its moderate Stalinist branch. This ideology has ruled the Soviet Union from Joseph Stalin's era to now, with some leaders deciding to ease authoritarian power at certain points. While it has certainly shifted in the past hundred years, Bolshevism still keeps Russia from foreign influence and maintains the glory of Communism within such an enormous nation. Unlike China, it seems a socialist system has worked far more efficiently and prosperously in the USSR, which is why our government has decided to emulate it. Instead of establishing a Maoist peasant's revolution, the Politburo declared a new era for Britain. This will supposedly see the empowerment of all workers and oppressed labourers throughout British lands, as well as a possible future alliance with the Soviets."

These ideologies have seemingly brought great misfortune for both nations and their satellite states around the world, with various factions trying to consolidate power... usually resulting in a disgusting amount of deaths. Hence the Communist Party of Great Britain declared this morning a new era for the British people, not one of a peasant's revolution or workers' revolution, but a total revolution for every single class and occupation of our society. No longer shall we be confined by the restrictions of other leaders' beliefs. British Socialism will prevail."

However, successive governments have still refrained from labelling their foreign policy as isolationist or anything along the lines of it, instead advocating for 'relaxed' international engagement. Now our recently elected government has made an official drastic change to the Foreign Office's activities, with the Prime Minister making a special announcement just a few hours ago.

It was located on a spot referred to in the 1950s by Churchill as 'where my statue will go'. Unveiled by his widow Lady Clementine Spencer-Churchill in 1973, the unveiling was attended by the serving Prime Minister and four former Prime Ministers, while Queen Elizabeth II gave a speech. It was one of eight statues on the central green of Parliament Square, all of well-known statesmen. However, all this history has been swept aside by the incumbent government, choosing to replace Churchill's statue with one of the former fascist politician Oswald Mosley. This statue will stand outside the Palace of Westminster, 2 metres taller than its predecessor ornament, observing Londoners as they go about their daily lives.

Until now their terroristic statements have been met with little retaliation from this administration, and the British people were beginning to get fed up, demanding that we do something about not just Corbyn and his cronies, but all traitorous leftists. Last night however, special security forces alongside the army stormed political headquarters and homes of known leftists, immediately searching the premises and arresting all within.

It didn't take long for cabinet to conclude that it would be highly beneficial for these divisions to be made, delivering a document to Ms. Brasier just a few hours later. The document called for an Internal Protection Unit and British Salvation Unit. Immediately signed by the High Secretary, the document has only just came into effect, with employees of Mlitary Intelligence Section 6 and other security services being shifted into each unit, while some remained in the aforementioned outdated organisation."

And yesterday, that is what she ordered. Alongside the head of British Police and the Army Chief, our great leader proclaimed a new era for Britain... one of unity, harmony and peace within all its territories, followed by a direct warning to all Scottish dissidents.

While still weary from her late flight and irritated by an unaccommodating hotel service, the Princess decided to drive herself to Buckingham Palace. Diana and William departed from Heathrow Airport through a runway exit just past midnight, heading for central London, purposefully avoiding any paparazzi that may have been alerted to their presence. After arriving in London proper, the pair drove past the Science Museum and along Queen's Gate. At around 12:41 AM, at the intersection with Cromwell Road, Diana was seemingly not paying attention to the situation in front of her, and collided with another car at significant speeds. She proceeded to lose control of the car, swerving to the left before colliding again head-on with the walls of the Yemeni Embassy. Finally coming to a stop, onlookers rushed to the car only to find the bloody mess that was Princess Diana, and a terribly injured Prince William in the back.

Afterwards the situation spiralled out of control fast, as the assassination of popular judge Mustafa Abdul Jalil triggered protests in which thousands were killed, prominent generals resigned and Tunisia declared independence from the republic.

With little time to spare, the King managed to escape with his wife and children in a helicopter, leaving the country briefly until they returned. Instead of Rome, the royals set their sights on the original home of the Savoy family, Piedmont. Arriving in the capital at midnight, the King set his scheme in motion to rebel against Italy and reorganise the 'legitimate' monarchy in the North. In the process, several key figures within the national military defected to their commander in chief, declaring that the Bonaparte family had no right to once again rule over Italy."

Miuccia Prada, CEO of the luxury fashion house Prada, has a great reputation amongst the wealthy population and the working class at the same time, due to her charitable populist efforts in recent years.

Only proving the slippery slope 'fallacy' that radical Communists had espoused once the Historic Compromise was established, democrats within Napolitano's new cabinet threatened to resign if he didn't act now on constitutional change for all of Italy. The most significant of these proposed amendments is freedom of speech, granting Italian citizens the right to say whatever they wish, even if it goes against the central government. After much deliberation, the President stepped in front of Congress to declare his full support for all proposals, resulting in obvious outrage from the Communist Party and cheers from the Christian Democrats. As the head of state has a supreme vote in Congress during a state of emergency, the constitution was amended just a few hours ago, even without the full support of the Party."
 italy.69.o1:0 "Great"
 italy.70.t:0 "Freedom of Demonstration"
 italy.70.d:0 "A second constitutional amendment has been passed through Congress with the President's supreme vote overriding the opposition of radical communists. Like the establishment of freedom of speech, the Christian Democrats' 'Italian Protest and Political Activism' Bill will supposedly push Italy to a more democratic society, with all citizens now permitted to protest against the government without fear of treasonous accusations, usually followed by arrests or execution. An unnamed source from within the Communist Party told international media that the largest political organisation in the country is becoming increasingly worried about President Napolitano's amendments and love affair with the Christian Democrats. Some are even fearing for their life in the face of a possible purge from the moderate faction."
 italy.70.o1:0 "You have nothing to be afraid of"
 italy.71.t:0 "Future Elections Promised"
 italy.71.d:0 "Alongside various members of the Communist and Christian Democratic parties, the President has announced that there will be a general election held across Italy at some point. Refusing to give a set date, this announcement has been seen by many pro-democracy activists as a way to appease their movement without directly offering evidence of change. Supporters of the President and Christian Democratic leaders however, have already stated that this clearly shows he is ready to bring back the Republic and all of its democratic institutions, as long as activists can remain subdued in the coming months. They instead say riots or protests against the administration could bring negotiations to a grinding halt, and end the second Historic Compromise hardly long after it began."
 italy.71.o1:0 "Excellent"
 italy.72.t:0 "Crackdown on Protests"
 italy.72.d:0 "In response to the lack of a defined general election date from Napolitano's administration, radical democrats have voiced their opposition by protesting against its 'corruption and tyranny'. These protests spread across the country, drawing millions to their cause, something that the President himself stated was simply unacceptable in a nation trying its hardest to transition towards democracy. After these statements, Napolitano ordered police and the army to crackdown on violent protesters in particular, then proceeded to extend that order to even peaceful demonstrators. As the event died down, Italians are left wondering whether the government is truly working towards democracy... or if it's all a lie to keep them under control."
 italy.72.o1:0 "Calm down"
 italy.73.t:0 "Italian Corporations Return"
 italy.73.d:0 "The years of nationalisation following the Communist Party's 1984 electoral victory hit our industrial and financial sectors hard. As corporations fled the country and executives removed all of their investments, the economy plummeted, sending our new government into crisis-mode. Thankfully they were able to restore order through careful negotiations with the European Union, foreign investors and a stronger work ethic amongst the Italian people. However, [Root.GetLeader]'s new policies have seen the return of many corporations and even the same executives that left decades ago. In various statements to journalists, these executives claimed that the path this administration has set itself upon is simply waiting for a return to 'prosperous capitalism', and that they are prepared to deliver it."
 italy.73.o1:0 "Interesting"
 italy.74.t:0 "Senate Writes New Constitution"
 italy.74.d:0 "After the National Congress was abolished just a few weeks ago, its successor the restored Italian Senate was granted sweeping powers by [Root.GetLeader]. These powers included the ability to amend and ultimately completely re-write the constitution, rendering this 'Senate' a constituent assembly akin to the one established in 1985 by President Napolitano. After weeks of intense debate, Senators have finally completed the first draft of a constitution, which shall come into effect once approved by the Chamber of Deputies and [Root.GetLeader] himself. Overall, this constitution has been labelled as revolutionary by many, and a true example of Italy's new democratic political system, something that current generations have never seen before."
 italy.74.o1:0 "Great"
 italy.75.t:0 "Italy Leaves European Union"
 italy.75.d:0 "Effective immediately, the Senate has approved [Root.GetLeader]'s recommendation to leave the European Union of Socialist Republics. This economic and political organisation has confined Italy to communism and a destructive foreign policy, guided by the tyrannical Soviet government. Now our nation can finally break free from its chains and set a new path for itself, no longer influenced by the superpowers of years gone by. Soon Italy shall be at the forefront of international democratic revolution against the oppressive Moscow world order. However, this is surely to attract criticism from some economic analysts, who believed that the Republic could remain an observer state of the European Union. But in all honesty, said [Root.GetLeader], how can a democratic nation stay without the nearby dictatorships attempting to crush its 'spring'?"
 italy.75.o1:0 "Finally we have been freed"
 italy.76.t:0 "Italian Republic Restored"
 italy.76.d:0 "After decades of centralised rule from Rome, many democrats proposed a confederate system for this new Italy. This would have established relatively independent nations throughout the peninsula, only constricted by a common defence, foreign policy and some other administrative connections from the capital. Fortunately, such a proposal was unanimously rejected by the Chamber of Deputies and Senate, with members declaring that this would have brought the ultimate collapse of Italy, not long after it had gained its democratic freedom from the Soviet Union and communism as a whole. Instead, the old Republic of Italy's system has been restored, with the office of Prime Minister re-established this morning. President Napolitano has resigned from the Presidency, and his successor will soon be selected by the two aforementioned legislative bodies."

Fortunately, it was unanimously accepted by the Chamber of Deputies and Senate, with members declaring that this will bring the ultimate restoration of democratic values and freedom for all Italians, not long after we gained our true independence from communism. Just like the old Republic of Italy, the office of Prime Minister has been re-established this morning, but it will have limited power compared to the Presidents of each nation within the confederation. President Napolitano has resigned from the Presidency, and his office will instead not be maintained."
 italy.77.o1:0 "Long live the Confederation!"
 italy.78.t:0 "Executive Presidency Established"
 italy.78.d:0 "To the shock of many throughout the nation, Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] has left a meeting with the President to announce his immediate resignation and the subsequent abolition of his very own office. It seems the meeting of Italy's two most powerful politicians brought the issue of an executive presidency to the forefront of our political discussion, as this is the very system now being established by the President and Prime Minister together. However, it was the second news that came as an even greater shock. Instead of removing himself from politics, or at least the central administration, Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] will be taking the head of state's position, and the latter will be taking the new counterpart of Vice President."
 italy.78.o1:0 "Intriguing"
 italy.79.t:0 "Congress Bans Refugees"
 italy.79.d:0 "In accordance with Napolitano's wishes, the National Congress has passed a revised bill which shall ban Libyan and Tunisian refugees from Italy, effective immediately. This ban will affect both those already in the country, and those hoping to come across the Mediterannean or may already be on their way. Our Secretary of State Matteo Renzi stated that this is essential to maintaining the cultural, social, political and economic harmony within Italy, clearly influenced by the nationalist faction within President Napolitano's cabinet. This faction in particular has been the most vocal against refugees, repeatedly demanding that the President ban them even without Congress' consent."

 italy.80.t:0 "Humanity For All Speech"
 italy.80.d:0 "'In no way can the Italian people and this government stand by and watch as thousands flee a besieged nation, only to die at the hands of a vicious sea. These refugees must be given a warm home with the same welcome that us Italians have given many in the past. Because if we are to remain a socialist nation representing all humans, then we must also remain a socialist nation that helps all humans. Humanity can not be reserved for the privileged, the deeply religious or the most pure of heart, as humanity is something that every single person on this planet holds dear. It is all they have when everything else has been swept away by conflict and oppression. When Italy claims 'humanity for all', then we should follow through with our vision and let all those in need into our country. That is the Italian way and that is the socialist way.' - President Napolitano."

 italy.81.t:0 "President Endorses European Communism"
 italy.81.d:0 "At a recent meeting of diplomats and Italian ambassadors to various nations around the world, [Root.GetLeader] made a shocking foreign policy diversion. Instead of endorsing the Soviet order and Warsaw Pact as is common for the head of state to do at every conference of this magnitude, he stated that a new socialist axis should be created in the heart of Europe. These statements, seen as a direct endorsement of the 'Eurocommunism' movement, were met with outrage from the Soviet leadership and many other governments throughout the Warsaw Pact. However, some other heads of government were intrigued by the comments, indicating that they could perhaps follow President Napolitano in his new path for anti-Soviet communist supremacy on the continent. Only time will tell if Moscow decides to retaliate with force against a rebellious ally."
 italy.81.o1:0 "Interesting"
 italy.82.t:0 "President Denounces European Communism"
 italy.82.d:0 "At a recent meeting of diplomats and Italian ambassadors to various nations around the world, [Root.GetLeader] made an unsurprising foreign policy announcement. Instead of simply endorsing the Soviet order and Warsaw Pact as is common for the head of state to do at every conference of this magnitude, he also stated that Eurocommunists within Congress would be hunted down and crushed for the good of our alliance. These statements, seen as an attack on the growing ideology, were met with outrage from some socialists within Italy, Europe and the world, but were naturally graciously celebrated in Moscow and other capitals. They certainly don't set a new precedent for Napolitano's administration, but perhaps this means the President will be working closer together with the Soviets to secure a strong Communist axis across continents."
 italy.82.o1:0 "Interesting"
 italy.83.t:0 "Crackdown on Nationalist Dissent"
 italy.83.d:0 "Nationalists threaten to destroy our harmonious way of life, demanding their irrelevant state be granted full independence from the Italian Union. Unfortunately, for the past two decades we've been unable to completely stop them in their tracks, but it didn't take long for the President to convince his cabinet that a strong show of force was the right course of action. Instead of negotiations and appeasement, the Italian military and police have orchestrated a coordinated crackdown on nationalist dissent throughout the country. Soon, the last remnants of these repulsive groups will be wiped off the face of the planet, and Italy will be one again."
 italy.83.o1:0 "Excellent"
 italy.84.t:0 "President and Mafia Meet"
 italy.84.d:0 "Unlike President Napolitano's previous cabinet discussions on the mafia situation, things have taken an unusual and highly controversial turn. Instead of advocating for a violent crackdown on mafia activities as has been state policy for two decades, the President has secretly met with key figures within various organisations throughout Italy. In these meetings it was concluded that the state and mafia could work together to an extent, allowing for greater economic prosperity and a sense of calm within the general populace. Whether this will actually occur is another question, but at the moment it is clear that Napolitano is desperate to gain more friends... and avoid another crisis."
 italy.84.o1:0 "Ok"
 italy.85.t:0 "Campaign Against the Mafia"
 italy.85.d:0 "Italian divisions and police are now actively hunting mafia underlings throughout the country, while intelligence agencies are beginning to track down bosses. This is just the first step in a renewed campaign designed by President Napolitano to purge the mafia from Italy. While previous campaigns have been relatively unsuccessful, with public opinion clearly in favour of appeasement and a peaceful resolution, early results are already showing that their power in Southern Italy has been greatly diminished. Just last night, a secret meeting between dons was ambushed by security forces with zero casualties, and interrogators believe these bosses could be convinced to give away valuable information in exchange for their life. Finally, the people of Italy can be at peace knowing their administration is taking real action against this repulsive threat."
 italy.85.o1:0 "Destroy them"
 italy.86.t:0 "Napolitano Condemns Human Rights Violations"
 italy.86.d:0 "In a startling speech to the United Nations General Assembly in Geneva, President Napolitano has condemned supposed human rights violations within his own nation. As members of the Communist Party watched in shock from the National Congress Building, our head of state unleashed fire and fury on fellow politicians, declaring that this 'reign of oppression' in Italy must come to a swift and decisive end. What kind of end that would be, the President didn't say. Whatever the scheme Napolitano may have planned against hardliners within his own party, including the notorious chief of the People's Security Agency, many in the General Assembly gave him a standing ovation. However, it was clear how furious many delegates were, especially those from the Warsaw Pact and even many anti-Soviet states around the world."
 italy.86.o1:0 "Amazing"
 italy.87.t:0 "President Talks About Christianity"
 italy.87.d:0 "'My good friend Cardinal Bergoglio has said that - 'We have observed that, in society and the world in which we live, selfishness has increased more than love for others, and that men of good will must work, each with his own strengths and expertise, to ensure that love for others increases until it is equal and possibly exceeds love for oneself.' - As he stands beside me today, I am reminded of how important the Catholic Church and God himself is in Italy's society, culture and people. In times when we were more divided and harsh than ever, the light of our holy father guided us towards peace and reconciliation, and yet for years I have denied this fact. My government has denied this fact. It's time we as your leaders started to tell you the truth and act not in our own self-interests, but in the interests of all Italians and the divine word of God.' - [Root.GetLeader]"
 italy.87.o1:0 "Excellent quote and excellent speech"
 italy.88.t:0 "Hardline Communists Fired"
 italy.88.d:0 "Members of the hardline faction within Italy's Communist Party have been forced to resign by the President this morning, reportedly due to their opposition to his latest comments on Christianity and rapid progress to a non-Communist government. While our head of state is yet to officially announce the resignations, his Chief of Staff met with journalists just a few hours ago to discuss this sudden but almost universally expected action. According to his highest senior staff member, these hardliners had to go because of the friction they were causing within Congress and at cabinet meetings. Whatever the outcome of this may be, we can be certain that Napolitano will be able to go through with his reforms far easier. But if he lingers too long, Congress could attempt to overthrow him in a bloodless impeachment."

 italy.89.t:0 "Pope Meets With Napolitano"
 italy.89.d:0 "A historic meeting between the Italian President and head of the Catholic Church has captivated our world. For the first time since 1985, a Pope has set foot in Italy, and Paul VII was clearly ecstatic to be making these historic steps himself in front of billions eagerly watching. On the streets of Rome, the holy father's motorcade was met with overwhelming cheers and tears from the sidewalk and even from windows above. Upon arriving at the President's palace, the two leaders briefly exchanged words before being led into the host's office to discuss a range of issues. Hours later, the Pope emerged alongside his Italian counterpart with an announcement that has sent shockwaves across the planet. Effective immediately, he shall resign as head of the Catholic Church and will call for a papal conclave as soon as possible. President Napolitano proceeded to declare that this conclave would be held in the Vatican for the first time since the infamous 'Exile of the Cardinals'."
 italy.89.o1:0 "Napolitano is truly a deal maker!"
 italy.90.t:0 "National Congress Overthrown"
 italy.90.d:0 "The National Congress of Italy has rapidly grown to be a staunch opponent of President Napolitano, with impeachment proceedings supposedly beginning in secrecy just a few days ago. Anticipating this action from his fellow colleagues, the head of state ordered an unprecedented attack on his legislative house that no one could have seen coming. As Congress met in the middle of the day, General Vincenzo Camporini was ordered by Napolitano to march his soldiers onto the streets of Rome, with their eyes set on the NCI building. The highly decorated military veteran accepted his commander in chief's wishes with immediate action, pulling all divisions out of training and ordering several subordinates to secure key positions throughout the capital. Camporini himself then proceeded to enter the building with an entourage of soldiers and secret police, proclaiming himself Chairman of the Communist Party. Italy is still reeling from this shocking act and many have openly declared their disdain for the now powerless body. The question remains however, what will Camporini do with his newfound powers as the second most powerful man in the Italian Union?"
 italy.90.o1:0 "The bastards are gone!"
 italy.91.t:0 "High Council Dissolved"
 italy.91.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has just announced at the latest meeting of the Italian High Defence Council, that the aforementioned body will be dissolved to make way for a new military administration. What kind of administration this will be remains unknown, but it's highly likely that [Root.GetLeader] plans to reshuffle the entire admiralty and many of his generals, who are part of an old military clique lasting since before Communist victory in 1984."

 italy.92.d:0 "As one of his first acts in the office of Communist Party Chairman, General Vincenzo Camporini has ordered the arrest of every single high level member of the Italian Communist Party, including President Napolitano. Upon hearing this announcement, politicians who had expected the head of state to change his mind and restore National Congress to its old duties, scattered throughout the country. Some escaped via the seas and air, but Camporini's secret police managed to capture most in a swift end to more than 20 years of Communist rule. As the dust settled, it had become increasingly clear that President Napolitano was nowhere to be found and had fled Rome. Whether he is eventually found is relatively irrelevant to the Chairman, because now he has total control over Italy's administrative bodies and can enact any reforms he so desires."
 italy.92.o1:0 "A second coup!"
 italy.93.t:0 "Democracy Restored"
 italy.93.d:0 "Chairman-General Vincenzo Camporini has just resigned from his official duties, instead proclaiming a provisional democratic government to oversee the drafting of a new constitution and restoration of order throughout Italy. Taking control as Provisional Prime Minister is Raffaele Fitto, leader of the People of Freedom Party, an exiled political organisation drifting between the United Kingdom and Canada in recent years. With this democratic system in place, it will be up to him to decide what kind of reforms must be enacted, especially as support for a monarchist revival grows. It's likely that the Prime Minister could demand a constitutional referendum that would ask voters the important question of whether they wish to live in a Republic, or a monarchy."
 italy.93.o1:0 "Ok"
 italy.94.t:0 "Kingdom Vote Wins"
 italy.94.d:0 "Results are coming in from across Italy, and already it's clear that the monarchist vote has won by a landslide. After living through a turbulent Italian Republic from 1946 to 1985 and the oppressive communist Italian Union onwards, its people have seemingly had enough of the corruption and instability. In its place, they have chosen to bring back the Savoy dynasty as the rulers of this land, and hence the Kingdom of Italy. Millions throughout the country rejoiced at the recent news, and of course the royal family themselves were ecstatic upon hearing the news from their home in Canada. Living in exile for countless decades, these tortured souls will finally be able to return and take back what was always rightfully theirs."

 italy.95.d:0 "While the referendum was already won, Victor Emmanuel IV has still not officially become the head of state of the Italian Kingdom. This all changed an hour ago, with the coronation of Italy's first monarch since 1946 captivating audiences around the world. This opulent event televised to more than a hundred countries attracted celebrities, royals and other heads of government, who all celebrated this magnificent achievement orchestrated by the Italian people themselves. As the crown was placed on the new King's head, cheers deafened all within the palace and the streamers, balloons and fireworks were already going off in the streets. A large portion of the population however was not so pleased with this development, declaring royal restoration a 'capitalist farce'. Nevertheless, this was truly a day to remember for centuries to come... and hopefully the monarchy won't end again so swiftly."

 italy.96.t:0 "Right Wing Coalition Created"
 italy.96.d:0 "King Victor Emmanuel IV has proclaimed a royal coalition with various far right parties within the recently established Italian Chamber of Deputies and Senate. These two legislative bodies will now hold a majority of neo-fascist politicians from a range of parties. According to palace sources, leaders have pledged allegiance to the monarch in an effort to survive during turbulent political years. [Root.GetLeader] could have chosen to abolish his constitutional restrictions and establish a total dictatorship, but apparently this move was made to appease democratic movements and populists who claim the King wants to exert unrestrained power over Italy. Whether the Senate will accept his rule in line with their pledge is another matter, but for the moment this coalition will surely ease any tensions within our new political system."

However, such a sudden decision was sure to displease the millions who had voted for a Savoy King of Italy in our recent constitutional referendum... possibly leading to a disastrous civil war. Instead, Berlusconi weighed up all of his options for weeks, meeting with military leaders and a gathering of Bonaparte family members. Finally, [Root.GetLeader] has just signed an official declaration of war against rebel Piedmont, ordering divisions on the border to move in and secure Italian supremacy. Surely they can not win this war..."

Facing mounting criticism from capitalists and reformers, [Root.GetLeader] has called for rapid mass privatisation of the Italian economy effective immediately. This act will establish an advisory board to observe the process and ensure that everything runs smoothly. As well as this, those involved in the initial nationalisation era have been arrested by security services in the waking hours of this morning.

Some expected the head of government to make use of their unique position to revive Napoleon Bonaparte's methods of securing power, but it seems this was only useless speculation. According to a poll conducted today, millions of Italians are relieved that a true constitutional monarchy had been established on the peninsula, rather than an absolute dictatorship as many Republican advocates stated would occur if the royal vote won. Now everyone has been assured that King Victor Emmanuel IV and Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] are on the same page, despite the latter having all the power."

To counter this worrying situation, the head of state alongside his elected counterpart [Root.GetLeader] delivered an ultimatum to the Senate floor. Either politicians accepted his powers and constitutional role over the Kingdom of Italy, or he would immediately dissolve it for another general election. While this could have been an extremely risky move, public opinion probably convinced him that this was the right course of action. Recent polls indicated that the Italian people were sick and tired of Senators changing the subject when asked about the King, and refusing to pass many of the Prime Minister's laws approved by a lower house. Once the ultimatum was delivered, the upper house descended into chaos. Some called it tyrannical and some immediately accepted after observing more of these aforementioned polls.

Labelling General Vincenzo Camporini as a puppet of former President Giorgio Napolitano and a threat to the nation's security, party leaders have seized control over most of the city, from small locations like postal offices to large administrative buildings such as the Aviation Ministry. It seems the army was taken by surprise, with many even joining neo-fascist marchers in their quest for power over our whole country.

Now with absolute power, the Romanophile Italian Social Movement can secure its grip over the peninsula and maintain the mystique of Roman restoration. If everything goes to plan, a Senate will be established in a matter of months, but it is unclear how political organisations will react to this blatant disregard for their once constitutionally ensured rights within Italy.

According to the Secretary of State, its goals shall be the restoration of order throughout the Roman Empire through negotiation with organisations not necessarily opposed to [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership, and a harsh crackdown on militant groups.

No longer will our children rejoice on a day that should be one of mourning. No longer will the old Social Republic's ideals remain tarnished in the eyes of Italy's united people.

Instead of a cult of personality surrounding the Second Duce, total power has been transferred to the state body, allowing members to dominate the military, industrial, political and economic aspects of Italy.

Whether this was successful back then is another matter, but what is certain now, is that [Root.GetLeader] has great faith in the new intelligence body. Millions of Italy's budget has been assigned to OVRA, as part of the Social Movement's plan to enforce direct control over every aspect of the Italian peoples' lives.

Even compared to those conducted by Benito Mussolini's reign, the sheer magnitude of this operation has shocked many in the international community but pleased many within Italy. With opposition activists executed at midnight by secret police, and those already imprisoned hanged on street corners, the people can finally be at ease knowing their nation is stable and secure again.

However, while this might seem like a radical move to most international observers, the fact that a significant portion of Communists have moved to a new party has raised eyebrows. This recently established Socialist Reconstruction Party supposedly aims to restore democratic rule in Italy and ensure that human rights are no longer violated by a tyrannical government. President [Root.GetLeader] has officially been sworn in as both Italian head of state and leader of the SRP, one of the only key figures within this political organisation that hasn't previously been a ranking Communist Party member. Whatever the administration itself might say, some claim this is a true democratic party with the old Italian Republic's ideals on its mind. Others however are less pleased with recent developments, labelling [Root.GetLeader] a Union sympathiser, and the entire Reconstruction Party a sham designed to fool a poor populace."

In parallel to the original Italian Republic founded in 1946, the military no longer stands alongside whatever leaders reside in Rome, but only the recently proclaimed Socialist Reconstruction Party. Leaks and speculation are still spiralling out of control in Rome, meaning political analysts are unsure whether it was key military figures who decided on this course of action themselves, or whether it was [Root.GetLeader] himself who demanded generals surrender total obedience to him."

Only in the past few days however have things become far more serious, with these same repulsive 'reformers' organising strikes throughout Italy and protests in the heart of Rome, causing major disruption to our economy and the lives of millions of hard working Italians. Fortunately, President [Root.GetLeader], his cabinet and a majority of the National Congress have decided to ban these anarchists in the name of peace, prosperity and security on this peninsula.

 italy.112.d:0 "At a monthly conference of key figures within the Socialist Reconstruction Party and allied political organisations, President of the Republic [Root.GetLeader] has reaffirmed ties to the European Union. Although his government has renounced any ties to the former Italian Communist Party, he and the Foreign Minister declared just a few hours ago that it would be abhorrently irresponsible to leave the European Union over ideological differences. Commentators have mocked the statements, suggesting that in fact Italy's current administration is hardly any different to other Warsaw Pact nations, considering the past of many of its highest ranking officials. Nevertheless, the President has surely secured Italy as an economically strong nation for the future, by not caving into ridiculous 'Italeave' demands."

 italy.113.d:0 "Rivalling all other Socialist Internationals and the Warsaw Pact, the Socialist Reconstruction Party has announced that a new worldwide organisation will be established to secure the existence of radical leftism, and the defeat of reactionary forces on every continent. What countries will join and how soon is another question, but for now everyone is asking how much power Italy will have in this new 'Socialist International', and whether it's a political league or in fact a full-fledged military alliance. To the first question, the Foreign Minister stated that while Italy will have sweeping powers, all members will have a say in meetings and no one nation is explicitly more important than another. To the second, she told journalists that it will not take long for this current league of socialist parties to develop into a formidable military alliance of nations. Such a military alliance would apparently be aimed at fighting fascism, especially in the former United States, Africa and any other continent where it's deemed necessary."

 italy.114.d:0 "After decades of centralised rule from Rome, many democrats proposed a confederate system for this new Italy. This will establish relatively independent nations throughout the peninsula, only constricted by a common defence, foreign policy and some other administrative connections from the capital. Fortunately, it was unanimously rejected by the Chamber of Deputies and Senate, with members declaring that this would bring the ultimate collapse of Italian society and democracy, not long after we gained our true independence from communism. But instead of restoring the old Italian Republic, both state bodies have agreed on a compromise for both sides of this issue. The Italian Federation will grant far more rights to each regional government, and hand over stronger economic management to devolved parliaments. President Napolitano has resigned from the Presidency, and his successor will soon be selected by the two aforementioned legislative bodies."

Even in the two state bodies, seperate currencies were unanimously rejected, with a more popular idea suggested to President [Root.GetLeader]. Effective immediately, a restoration of the old Lira will be established as the common currency for every regional government within this Confederation, allowing for greater trade prospects with the international community and smoother transitions for tourism or inter-confederal living. The Italian Central Bank opened its doors this morning for Chief Ardelli's important announcement, where she officially endorsed the Chamber of Deputies' plan and condemned any regional schemes to sabotage it."

However, it was Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader]'s startling proposal that sent the government into crisis mode and the general populace into a state of bewilderment. Instead of an Italian Confederation or Federation, he has suggested a unique 'Merchant Republic Plan', a fancy name for a new scheme that will establish special economic zones within certain Italian cities. These zones will have extremely low tax rates and allow for international business dealings that directly benefit the economy. The specifics haven't been laid out yet, but it can be expected that whatever the Prime Minister suggests, both legislative bodies will accept. His popularity rating has created a concerning situation especially for the Senate, as any actions against the PM will be met with harsh backlash from millions of Italians. It seems this unusual 'Merchant Republic Plan' will go forward as planned, and we will be seeing independent Republics springing out of nowhere around the country."

In this speech they stated the increased need for special economic zones within Italy, and the great prosperity they could bring to not just Venetians... but all Italians. After some economic drivel that bored most of the crowd, it was time for the populist message to come out in full force. [VNT.GetLeader] proudly made his first speech as the President of an independent nation, calling for a new golden era of capitalist supremacy over the spectre of villainous Communism. All treaties were appropriately signed and finally this 'merchant republic' has been set free by [Root.GetLeader] as part of his grand plan."

Restored in recent years along with a major restyling of the square, the fountain was a perfect backdrop for the greatest and most important speech delivered in Genoan history. While Rome had suggested pushing the date for Genoan independence further back, it was [Root.GetLeader] who managed to convince his cabinet that this merchant republic should be granted independent status as soon as possible. The address to thousands within the square talked of a glorious trade empire centuries ago, the prosperity of Genoa in this era, and how such a way of life could return. The regional governor, now President, was clearly pleased by his former head of state's words, following after him to the lectern to overwhelming cheers from below. It was a relatively short affair, but now the Republic of Genoa is independent from Italy, and the next merchant phase of the merchant republic plan has been efficiently completed."

It rose to become an economic powerhouse and dominated much of the Mediterranean and Italian trade networks for a century before being surpassed by Pisa, Venice and Genoa. It is this history that [Root.GetLeader] talked of today, but instead of a Duchy, the first Republic of Amalfi has been granted total independence from the Italian Republic. With a background of amazingly rising mountain peaks and a beautiful coastline, the mood was nothing short of ecstatic, as the people of Amalfi finally came to the realisation that their small town was about to become an integral foundation of the merchant republic plan."

 italy.120.d:0 "Unlike its other small counterpart in Amalfi, the Republic of Pisa lasted for four hundred years as a trade and economic powerhouse, being one of the four main historical maritime republics of Italy. The city, famed for its landmarks and attractions, has attracted even more fame and recognition this morning as [Root.GetLeader] proclaims a new era. For this city, no one could have ever imagined that it would be part of a maritime republic revival, this time under the merchant republic plan of Rome. According to government officials, it is more than likely that the recently proclaimed Republic of Pisa will be more attractive to investors than the other merchant republics, because of its extensive tourism culture and an influx of new citizens in previous years."

 italy.121.d:0 "As nation states, the merchant republics are currently useless to Italy, which is where the genius of [Root.GetLeader]'s scheme comes in. Effective immediately, every single special economic administrative zone will enact an executive order signed by the President of each region. This order will revoke the current tax rates and reduce them by an unimaginable amount, far below that of our Italian Republic. Finally, we can reap the benefits of this merchant republic plan, and the world will know an Italy that has risen from the ashes of an unbeatable crisis."

 italy.122.t:0 "Republics Adopt Lira"
 italy.122.d:0 "As a way of encouraging business between Italy and each of its new Republics, the city states have adopted our common currency, the Lira. According to economic and political analysts within Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader]'s team, adopting a common currency will only boost the profits gained from each merchant republic, especially within the tourism sector. However, the results from this move will only be evident in the coming years, and who knows what might have happened if each Republic adopted separate currencies. At least for now the international market is pleased that a sensible economic approach has been taken, rather than one riddled with uncertainty."

 italy.123.t:0 "Republics Adopt Separate Currencies"
 italy.123.d:0 "Contrary to the wishes of economists within Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader]'s cabinet and in particular the popular Finance Minister, the merchant republics have refused to adopt a common currency with Italy. This Lira would have supposedly led to greater cooperation and more economic benefits for every nation involved, but the PM and his party flatly refused to go through with such an extensive political scheme. Instead, each Republic has adopted a separate currency, but also announced more trade deals to be signed with the Italian Republic as soon as possible. Some have questioned whether this is truly a beneficial exchange, as the common Lira idea was considered to simply make the most sense in the international community. Nevertheless, there's no going back now, and every country on this peninsula shall soon have its own form of money, whether the establishment likes it or not."

While leaving a downtown hotel, the French politician and his entourage were directed to a second car down the road, as unexpected construction had blocked off more than half of that avenue. This proved fatal however, as an assassin was perched on the rooftops above waiting for the perfect shot. Perhaps if Hollande had left from the original location his life may have been spared, but knowing the kind of people that might want him dead, it would only have delayed his death by a few days. Nevertheless, just two shots were fired and the President was dead before he could be admitted to a nearby hospital.

It didn't take long for a tight election contest to be held on the floor, with various candidates from across the EU attacking each other on policies and personality. From Germany to Belgium and Italy to Romania, parliamentarians attempted to present themselves as a natural successor, highlighting either their close relationships with the previous President, or perhaps trying to appease the Soviet delegation who observed from afar. Nevertheless, with Italy having taken center stage in European affairs recently, parliament member Fausto Bertinotti was seen as the most likely to win. And win he did. By a unanimous vote after six rounds, the candidate from Milan was elected President of the European Union, with his victory accepted by the Soviets, who have veto powers over anyone aiming to become the most powerful politician in the European Union."

Early yesterday morning, as the Soviet delegation normally present at debates was on an official visit to Hungary, President of the Union Fausto Bertinotti called for an immediate convention of all members for one of the most important debates ever. Purposefully not informing the Soviets of such a convention, the Europeans debated for hours about uniting Europe's individual militaries under one high command, directly controlled by a council led by the President himself. If the Soviets were present, it's likely many members would have been reluctant to support and vote yes on such a measure, but because of this absence, the debate ended quickly and the executive order was signed even quicker. A crisis is clearly brewing on this continent, as [SOV.GetLeader] is reportedly furious that his delegation wasn't informed of the debate and that Parliament wend right under their nose to make such an important decision. Could this be the end of EU-Soviet relations forever?"

But with the collapse of most members by the end of 1985, the currency collapsed and was officially abolished by a recently established European Union of Socialist Republics. Now however the idea has been placed back on the table, and once again Parliament debated further measures furiously. This time however, the Soviet delegation made sure they were present, but unexpectedly didn't veto any bills that would restore a common currency for member states. Due to this indifference to the issue, parliamentarians discussed various proposals eagerly and finally agreed to create various European ministries that would manage the establishment of a Euro spanning the entire continent."

This preceded a vote on strengthening the powers of parliament and subsequently removing the Soviets' veto powers within every debate. As the aforementioned men were removed from the building in hysterics, Parliament passed the bill unanimously and officially declared the end of Soviet supremacy within their legislative body. However, Fausto Bertinotti didn't go so far as to condemn the Soviet Union or the Warsaw Pact, as any such action would result in the end of the European Union. While Moscow is certainly furious at recent developments, they wouldn't dare take direct action in a time when many European citizens support their Union. But perhaps if they wait too long to force Europe into toeing the line, it will be too late..."

Unanimously, each parliament agreed to President Napolitano's call to action, and the League of European Communists has been officially proclaimed as a political party in various nations.

The vocation of being a protector however, is not just something involving us Christians alone; it also has a prior dimension which is simply human, involving everyone. It means protecting all creation, the beauty of the created world. It means respecting each of God's creatures and respecting the environment in which we live. It means protecting people, showing loving concern for each and every person, especially children, the elderly, those in need, who are often the last we think about. It means caring for one another. These are the values of the holy Church and all of God's teachings, which is why today we must take a stand against the days of tyranny now hopefully long past. Now it is time for us as leaders of a power so significant it can rule a nation or a planet, to unite Italy under the banner of caring for all humans.

For his word is above any law, any leader, any movement on our pitiful Earth. Homosexuality is disobedience. Rebellion is disobedience. Abortion is disobedience.

While refusing to give a concrete reason for these removals, essentially career terminations, Pope Francis has made it clear in the past that his rule as Pope would be one of anti-Conservatism and a rethinking of traditional values. Coincidentally, all those removed from their posts were members of a deeply conservative faction within the College of Cardinals, who had initially opposed Francis' rise to power, until convinced otherwise by a league of moderates who mediated between progressives and traditionalists. This 'coincidence' has certainly raised eyebrows, but naturally Francis continues to reject any notion that forced removals were enacted due to ideological differences between him and his colleagues."

However, decades of ideological battle between two forces that shouldn't naturally be ideological have possibly come to an end today. In his speech to the people of Rome and all those who have come across the land and seas to our holy capital, Pope Francis proclaimed the end of this opposition. Instead, he stated that science and religion can work together to forge a better understanding of our world and what God has created.

Giuliano Amato arrived accompanied by lass pomp and circumstance commonplace in meetings with the most powerful religious leader in the world, claiming that this was only a humble discussion between two humble men. The meeting lasted almost five hours after Francis took Amato on an extended tour of the Vatican as they discussed politics, economics and social issues of the time. Eventually however, the Socialist Party leader exited the Vatican with a smile on his face and warm words for journalists waiting aside.

European politicians had convened in Brussels today to discuss the Italian issue and our head of state in particular, but they never expected Congress to take such a dramatic action with little consultation.

Quietly waiting outside, one of Pius' old rivals Cardinal George Pell expected the Pope to reject their constitution, but instead he came out with solemn approval and a demand for this to be finalised as quickly as possible.

However, today it was King [Root.GetLeader] who personally invited the Pontiff to return to Italy and establish himself as a great leader for the Catholic Church. On the one hand, monarchists are ecstatic that their King is restoring many of the old traditions once held so dear to our hearts, but some are worried that the Pope could try something daring against Rome's government. With the Italian Senate abolished indefinitely and [Root.GetLeader] ruling with absolute power, there would be little political strength to stop a rebellious Pope aiming to take Italy for himself. Hopefully nothing will come of these suspicions, but several members of cabinet are now actively trying to keep their distance from the holy father, and ensure that he is unable to exert significant influence over our King."

 italy.147.d:0 "Former President of the Italian Union Giorgio Napolitano has been apprehended in the mountains of Northern Italy, hiding with various revolutionary socialist rebel groups. It appears some members informed local security forces of his presence as revenge for the former head of state's rule as Communist leader from 1984, and in exchange for legal protection from Rome. Of course, these members were shunned by their rebel group and were still taken to Rome for trial and subsequent execution for treason against the Empire. Nevertheless, it is an outstanding victory for our new government and a great show for those who think they can hide from [Root.GetLeader]. President Napolitano will return to the capital in the coming days for a nationally televised confession to The Provisional Senate, where he will be forced to admit all the horrific acts he ordered while ruling."

However, it was decided by his administration that the time had come to finally restore the Roman Senate. This body represented the ideals of Rome and its restoration shows to the world that we are truly committed to continuing that old nation's legacy. Newly appointed Senators of the provisional body were sworn in just a few hours ago as full-fledged members, declaring their total allegiance to the Roman Empire and the Italian Social Movement. However, recent developments have raised eyebrows. Due to the nature and selection process of the old Senate, various lawyers, judges and other legal professionals were admitted into its ranks without being properly vetted for political opposition by the Party. This means that it's possible several Senators, or even all for that matter, do not entirely agree with the status quo and wish to usurp it."

 italy.149.d:0 "Slavery in ancient Rome played an important role in society and the economy. Besides manual labour, slaves performed many domestic services and might be employed at highly skilled jobs and professions. Unskilled slaves however, still worked on farms, in mines and at mills. Their living conditions were brutal, and their lives short. While reinstating slavery in a restored Empire would have been unheard of years ago, the presence of thousands of heretic Libyans and Tunisians within our borders gave The Senate an unforseen opportunity. Instead of banning refugees as many party members suggested, [Root.GetLeader] has called for the restoration of slavery for these illegal immigrants, subsequently ordering for their immediate capture and enslavement by security forces throughout the Italian peninsula. Soon all of them will be under our grip, and they shall get to work obeying us... whether they like it or not."

From the Colosseum to the smallest corners of the city, it became evident that work had begun at almost every point, and they hadn't pulled any punches. The sheer splendor of new buildings blew observers away, marvelling to both international and domestic journalists that this was the greatest state they have ever seen Rome in. And this is only a small part of the overall plan, as the CSP indicates almost 95 percent of Rome still remains to be rebuilt as according to how Romans saw it at the turn of BCE to CE."

 italy.151.d:0 "Until now the Roman Senate has managed to remain orderly and professional in its inner workings and debates. However, recent complications regarding the economy and the growing influence of certain factions has led to infighting within the Senate itself. Either with words or literally, Senators are at each other's throats, and the lack of Italian Social Movement vetting has created a storm of varying ideological enemies scrambling for power. Lower members of the party have demanded someone take supreme charge of both the body and the Empire as a whole, in order to restore peace, security and certainty. To the surprise of many, the Senators agreed and have now convened in the chamber to elect a 'Dictator' of Rome. Threats will be made, small battles will be fought, but in the end someone must come out on top... either by ballots cast or the death of their opposing colleagues."

His wife and two children broke the news to intrigued state journalists after they noticed ambulance vehicles speeding towards the house and a lack of emergency services chatter suggesting any politician had died. In a tragic press conference, the widow told Burma that her husband was a 'strong family man who lived for politics', a message that has certainly resonated with the general population. Khin Nyunt was revered by many as a truly unbiased judicial minister, and the first to ease government control over various legal proceedings. Although not a reformer in the general sense, he was still seen by pro-democracy groups as a democratic influence within the hardline [Root.GetLeader] administration and the authoritarian Council of Monks. This unexpected death has shocked the nation, and most still haven't really come to the realisation that their 'down-to-earth' minister has gone so suddenly."

So of course appointing Ko Ni as the next National Judicial Minister would be a truly historical move, enraging one side of the religious divide within Burma, and greatly pleasing the other. And while the Council of Monks has no control over cabinet selections, it is only natural that such a 'historical move' would be catastrophic for relations between the central administration and religious body. Now it is simply up to the President to decide however, on whether Burma's next Judicial Minister should be a Buddhist or a Muslim..."

Since the rise of [Root.GetLeader] in the 1990s, the Council has remained relatively sidelined in terms of political visuals, but maintained a strong presence behind every single politician in the People's Assembly. This means it's possible they could retaliate against this so-called 'repulsive Islamic administration'... strong words coming from a group that has endorsed our current President without hesitation for decades.

Admittedly, the Union's constitution does state that any political attack on Buddhism is grounds for removal from office through the Supreme Court. But in this situation, that Supreme Court is under the direct control of U Ko Ni, naturally leading to questions from the People's Assembly concerning conflict of interest within the highest levels of power. President [Root.GetLeader] has obviously rejected these radical demands, brushing them off as 'fascist psychos' in an unexpectedly ferocious press conference with domestic state and international journalists.

Before she could even open her mouth, Kyaw Swe immediately began listing his demands, including her resignation and the exile of U Ko Ni after his removal as National Judicial Minister. A deafening silence grew between the two long-time opponents, one representing the new socialist order that conquered Burma in 1997 and the other showcasing an iron-willed military presence lurking in the shadows. During this silence the President must decide her next move very carefully, and will be determing the fate of this country for many years to come, no matter what she does."

Nevertheless, the Council of Monks was ecstatic upon hearing of Aung San Suu Kyi stepping down, reportedly celebrating in a secret Yangon ceremony. They were even more excited about the future of Burma, as the President's letter of resignation handed over direct control of the People's Assembly to the Council. In accordance with their small 'constitution', the Council of Monks has now elected radical anti-Muslim government preacher Ashin Wirathu as Burma's head of state, after serving for several years as the Council Chief."

From anti-secular bills to heavy militarisation of Buddhist paramilitaries throughout the country, Wirathu has both angered and attracted significant popularity from different sects of Burma's population. But today, his most unexpected and radical 'reform' was put in motion. In the first Party Convention held since Aung San Suu Kyi's resignation, the President immediately dissolved the People's Assembly through an all-powerful executive order. Normally such an action would have been shot down by a united front of opponents, but Wirathu has managed to garner total support from his military and almost half of the very Parliament he proposed destroying. And thus the only legislative body within Burma to halt our new President's radical actions fell appart, with hundreds of members escorted out of the premises by force, screaming at the head of state with obvious hatred. Along with this executive order, he proceeded to officially dissolve the League for Socialist Salvation, ending any prospects of a return to more democratic rule."

They seem to believe that their military has been planning a coup against the Socialist Salvation League for years, and this could have been the tipping point where Burma's socialist utopia collapsed.

Ko Ni himself has made sure to remain out of the spotlight in this horrific turn of events, as our citizens begin to form a united front of proud socialist fervor against a historically right wing army clique. As of now President [Root.GetLeader] hasn't made any statements regarding this backlash against one of the most stable foundations of our nation, but he did express sorrow alongside fellow members of the People's Assembly in an emergency Convention.

An official investigation has begun through an executive order from President [Root.GetLeader] with the full support of his legislative assembly, but this will more than likely be pointless as military leaders flee the country to start new lives. We have already received reports from our intelligence agency that Kyaw Swe's hardline faction have left Burma together on one plane, en route to Taipei.

Nevertheless, this address has proved to the world and a disgraced fascist clique that not only can religious enemies unite against a rising common foe, but also ideological enemies.

Just this morning the People's Assembly's Speaker and Council Chief held a joint press conference to address concerns with President [Root.GetLeader]'s position as head of state. In this conference they announced that the two influential bodies had agreed to an impeachment vote, to be held in less than a week, as soon as the National People's Assembly convenes with an all new array of members. This is bad news both for [Root.GetLeader] and the 'ruling' party as a whole, with their last safeguard under unopposed threat, and the path clear to total destruction of revolutionary socialism in the Burmese Union."

The President could be seen in tears upon hearing of the final results, remaining silently seated in her high chair with the shortest announcement in Burmese history. Standing in front of a victorious chamber, [Root.GetLeader] simply uttered 'Goodbye' and departed with nothing but her handbag and husband's ashes that once always remained next to the podium. Once she had left the premises, Assembly Speaker Maung Wuntha and leader of the Democratic Forces Coalition assumed her office as Acting President until a nationwide vote can be held for that position."

After all, most candidates for this vote spent millions on campaigning in the legislative election, and already have their image or promises ready to slap on a new ballot.

Acting President and Speaker of the Assembly Maung Wuntha came out on top in primaries for the National Democratic League, and hopes to secure his position as our head of state for another permanent term. Than Nyein representing People's Liberation returned to Burma weeks ago after a self-imposed exile since his anti-Socialist activism during 1997's Lotus Revolution, and now seeks to establish a liberal democracy akin to that of the United Kingdom with a Westminster system. The political wing of Burma's Buddhist Association has nominated Win Tin as its candidate, once a strong supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi. In the face of Islamic terror on one side and Buddhist radical protests on the other, Min Ko Naing led the Secular Democratic Front to many historic victories during the legislative election, and hopes to solidify his newfound influence as President."

As New York's waking populace stood with shock and horror at the sight of jumping workers and flames engulfing every floor near the observation deck, it didn't take long for a second speeding jet to hit Tower 2. At this point, the entire nation and much of the world had tuned into breaking news of a terrorist attack on American soil, the first of this scale in history. Every minute, emergency services rushed to the scene, attempting to take thousands to safety with dwindling resources available. But then almost an hour later, all those watching must have gasped simultaneously at the most horrific thing to be seen on television. Tower 1 came crumbling down on top of itself, killing a thousand within and too many below the building, already struggling to escape the flames that had almost trapped them within their offices. Minutes later, Tower 2 fell to its demise in a similar fashion, tipping over almost at the very end and colliding with a nearby building, killing a hundred more. Now as the unprecedented dust cloud clears and the world remains in utter shock at this tragic attack on our humanity, no one is quite sure what will happen next."

The Chiefs of Police, Fire and Ambulance awaited their commander in chief's speech, but instead Chomsky decided to simply meet with emergency service workers to both help and emotionally support them during a testing time. In particular, eight men and women in the fire department have committed suicide in just the past day after experiencing the most shocking and horrific event in their careers. The President made a brief statement for journalists at City Hall after being with the bravest within New York for more than two hours.

As of now, the number of Americans and foreigners stranded at airports is rapidly rising, and some members of the Central Committee have condemned this executive decree due to it supposedly severely limiting economic development in coming weeks.

Today however, the lines are open and outpourings of sorrow and sympathy from world leaders reached Noam Chomsky as he set a course for New York. Some were clearly reluctant and spoke of solidarity through gritted teeth, but this is still a momentous occurrence as most of the world doesn't even recognise the Commonwealth as a legitimate nation, proven by its lack of representation within the United Nations. Even Donald Rumsfeld briefly spoke with one of his nemesis, while Warsaw Pact leaders and Chairman [SOV.GetLeader] refused to acknowledge that this was a tragedy, going about their lives as though nothing terrible had occurred on our soil."

No, that is not the essence of humanity.

To rise up from the bitterness and hatred of our enemies not with spears, but with the arsenal of freedom... of the knowledge that we are the humane. They are the inhuman, and they are the demons ready to slaughter thousands in the name of their wicked leader and a wicked system. Standing upon this podium in a city struck by tragedy I realise what the great poets of years gone by knew about our world, and I realise that our rise is not unlike the poetic justice of anything written about basic humanity in testing times. Today, I remember Tennyson's Ulysses, and to all Americans from the East Coast to West Coast I shall speak it not from my heart but from the heart of millions. We are not now that strength, which in old days moved Earth and heaven. That which we are, we are. One equal temper of heroic hearts. Made weak by time and fate.

In a nationally televised address from his home in Manhattan, Gates declared the time had come for new leadership in the Commonwealth, whether it came from President Chomsky's removal or the rejuvenation and restructuring of the Central Committee. He himself stated that this is certainly not an endorsement of either faction within Philadelphia's government, but instead a declaration of solidarity with the American people, not their appointed and elected officials.

While he was certainly bitter at blatant dissent from the New Guard faction within his supposedly loyal chamber, no one expected such a wave of anger and blame coming from Chomsky's mouth. Reversing their calls for his impeachment, the President stated that the Committee before him had failed America's people by purposefully continuing a disastrous political deadlock. He also noted that hardly any of them had come to New York to either simply pay their respects or help as volunteers like thousands of other Americans. It was at this point when temporary CC member and permanent Technology Council advisor John Holdren, standing in for a bed-ridden politician, shot up and screamed obscenities at Chomsky, labelling him a 'moronic anti-American preacher straight from the depths of hell'.

According to the eminent politician and one of the only neutral leaders between Old Guard and New Guard factions, circumstances within the small Himalayan nation meant he heard about May Day's tragedy an unfortunate number of days after it occurred. Of course this could be true but many have said Blasio's vacation was to the capital Thimphu, a region certainly not off the grid. This friction between different accounts and truth and falsity has put the Governor in a precarious position. Journalists within New York have been ordered to spin his late return into a positive light and enforce Blasio's statements, but questions surrounding the legitimacy of those claims will surely cause great distress for aforementioned journalists. Whether they toe the line or not, it is clear New York is extremely bitter about their supposed representative relaxing under the snow-capped peaks while his largest city mourns thousands of deaths."

In a joint statement that was cut from the air before they could finish, the rebellious group claimed that censorship had gone too far and a new media bill had to be introduced that would enforce greater freedom of the press. In turn, they effectively endorsed President Chomsky's plans for restructuring freedom of speech, association and demonstration, something that he hasn't been able to pass through the almost totalitarian Central Committee. The Governor is reportedly furious at this 'insubordination' but many Americans have taken the side of these journalists, demanding an end to injustices in the media.

According to their masked leader, May Day's tragedy was just the beginning of a series of attacks against our people and they would never stop until our reign was over. Intelligence agencies are scrambling to uncover more details about this group, but so far efforts have proven fruitless. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that they could have direct connections to the Vermont insurgency that ended earlier this year. This suspicion led to Governor Bernie Sanders publicly declaring that he will work with Philadelphia in any way that will result in the destruction of this 'repulsive' organisation.

As of now they have been unable to determine whether this chatter represents the former or latter of our enemies, but Chomsky is clearly determined to save his Governor from certain torture and possible death at the hands of vile radicals."
 commonwealth.28.o1:0 "Good thing we started that investigation"
 commonwealth.29.t:0 "President Orders Investigation"
 commonwealth.29.d:0 "After just a few days, the American people began to protest against Noam Chomsky for supposed neglect of their innocent Governor Davis. His reluctance to anger Old Guard allies has backfired, making him look weak and without a spine. Finally after eleven days the President has ordered an investigation into the disappearance of Kathy Davis, delivering a speech on the matter to furious members of the Indiana State Assembly, who had already begun to consider violating constitutional law and leading a direct investigation themselves. Now police can hopefully find the Governor before i's too late."
 commonwealth.29.o1:0 "Ok"
 commonwealth.30.t:0 "Kathy Davis Rescued"
 commonwealth.30.d:0 "A sudden raid in Southern Indiana has led to the discovery and subsequent rescue of Governor Kathy Davis, with no casualties on our side and total destruction of the small terrorist cell. With Davis on her way to Indianapolis in a secure motorcade, rumours are already flying around the country as people start wondering again who could have taken her. Whether they were communist radicals or right wing terrorists from the South, most citizens of Indiana are just glad that their faithful leader has returned with minimal injuries. President Chomsky was praised for immediate order to investigate her disappearance, rather than shying way in an attempt to avoid anger from the Old Guard for 'intervening in state affairs', despite his constitutional obligations."
 commonwealth.30.o1:0 "Great"
 commonwealth.31.t:0 "Police Tipped Off in Southern Indiana"
 commonwealth.31.d:0 "Police investigating the mysterious and potentially dangerous disappearance of Governor Kathy Davis have been tipped off in Southern Indiana by an unknown source. This anonymous tip off suggested that Davis had been taken to a rural location somewhere in the South-East, near the border with Kentucky. While police were initially sceptical, this was the only lead they had in this investigation, as any previous tip offs were virtually pointless due to Chomsky's lack of initiative in calling for an immediate investigation. State police are now on their way, and hopefully the Governor will be discovered safe and sound to be returned to Indianapolis."
 commonwealth.31.o1:0 "We can only hope"
 commonwealth.32.t:0 "Kathy Davis Returns to Indianapolis"
 commonwealth.32.d:0 "The abducted Governor arrived in Indiana's capital quite a few hours ago via motorcade, but she required time to rest at her second home and regain energy lost in those frightening days. Now with that restored she returned to the State Assembly in order to deliver a speech to fellow loyal colleagues and in turn, the frightened people of Indiana. After telling almost every detail of a horrific and surely life-threatening ordeal, her closing remarks called on all people of Indiana to rise up against terrorism and face our fears with resilience. A standing ovation from the State Assembly was seen on television sets across our entire Commonwealth, with every citizen captivated by the speed and efficiency of our police in bringing her home safely."
 commonwealth.32.o1:0 "Welcome back"
 commonwealth.33.t:0 "Police Chief's Grim News"
 commonwealth.33.d:0 "The Police Chief of Indiana has just informed President Chomsky that the 'tip off' in Southern Indiana was a set up, with his men and women almost slaughtered by an eagerly waiting terrorist cell. While the attackers were eventually killed upon the immediate arrival of reinforcements, Governor Kathy Davis was nowhere to be found. The President is reportedly furious about this entire event, and is considering sending in Commonwealth troops to the Western state, which would make his reluctance to 'intervene in state affairs' essentially pointless."
 commonwealth.33.o1:0 "This will end badly"
 commonwealth.34.t:0 "The White Phoenix"
 commonwealth.34.d:0 "Indiana's secret police have filed a report on the 'White Phoenix', a mysterious figure Governor Davis told them all her captors spoke of with ominous fear and admiration. While not much is yet known about the apparent leader of their crushed terrorist cell, President Chomsky will surely wish to be aware of any further developments. Perhaps this was the White Phoenix's grand scheme, and its failure will hopefully send him spiralling into obscurity at the hands of other terrorist leaders within the American Republic and abroad."
 commonwealth.34.o1:0 "Interesting"
 commonwealth.35.t:0 "Phone Call Between Rumsfeld and Chomsky"
 commonwealth.35.d:0 "In a desperate attempt to find Indiana Governor Kathy Davis, President Chomsky did the unthinkable. Just after his briefing with the state's most senior police officials, the commander in chief called his Republican counterpart in the South for the first time in the history of our two nations. Clearly Mr. Rumsfeld was caught off guard by the historic communication, but quickly came to understand that this call was not made out of desires for reconciliation and cooperation. Instead, Noam Chomsky had come to believe that the abduction of Governor Davis was orchestrated by radical groups across the Southern border, and was calling his decades-long nemisis to inquire as to how much the Atlanta government is aware of the current situation. Naturally, Rumsfeld responded by denying any involvement in the abduction, as well as knowledge of any radical groups operating within the American Republic. Chomsky's call ended with one side clearly angered and the other rejoicing that his enemy had come crawling to him in desperation."
 commonwealth.35.o1:0 "It was worth a shot"
 commonwealth.36.t:0 "Davis Forced to Read Manifesto"
 commonwealth.36.d:0 "Just two days after the historic phone call between Presidents Rumsfeld and Chomsky, the American people have awoken to a horrific image. All local stations are broadcasting footage of a beaten and crying Kathy Davis, being forced to read a terrifying manifesto to her own people. In the video, Davis is pushed around by men in white masks that never once speak, only directing her to look at the camera and begin speaking. Despite this monologue lasting many minutes, there was one key message to the entire ordeal... that these radicals will kill every single member of the Philadelphia government if it means another successful 'revolution against tyranny'. When ordered to stop speaking, the Governor sighs with relief but is promptly executed through a gunshot to the back of the head. As a bloody mess that was once the cheery leader of Indiana slumped to the ground, one masked man came forth in front of the camera to proudly proclaim that the 'Followers of the White Phoenix' were the most powerful group in America, and would stop at nothing to bring down our government. The footage stopped and citizens of this once peaceful Commonwealth are wondering whether their families are still safe..."
 commonwealth.36.o1:0 "Tragic"
 commonwealth.37.t:0 "Followers Become Top Terrorist Group"
 commonwealth.37.d:0 "As the horrific events of less than a week ago begin to settle into the minds of our emotionally broken citizens, the Internal Defence Secretary has just announced that the self-proclaimed 'Followers of the White Phoenix' are the number one enemies of the state and will be moved to the top of the counter-terrorism priority list. For his agency this is a historic move, as most groups on such a list have been minor, operating along the Commonwealth-Republic border and sabotaging local infrastructure."
 commonwealth.37.o1:0 "Ok"
 commonwealth.38.t:0 "Radical Terrorists Cross Border"
 commonwealth.38.d:0 "According to reports from the army and police, radical Southern terrorists have crossed the border in enormous numbers. A spike in infrastructure attacks of approximately 600% in the last week and direct announcements from well-known groups themselves that they were prepared to take advantage of the current civil war, has brought this issue to the Central Committee's attention. It seems that fateful decision to reject proposals for a border wall protecting our Commonwealth has just made the situation even more dire, as reports suggest that a solid structure surrounding neigbouring countries would have prevented border crossings in huge numbers."
 commonwealth.38.o1:0 "Let's hope this doesn't escalate"
 commonwealth.39.t:0 "Western Population Sides With Radicals"
 commonwealth.39.d:0 "The Western and Southern population of our Commonwealth is beginning to side with radicals crossing the border. Anger at the Central Committee for its coup against President Chomsky and neglect of rural communities has made it difficult for us to garner support for Philadelphia's goals in the civil war and future reconstruction of the country. But now the issue is no longer struggling to unite the Commonwealth once again... it is much more worrying. Our forces are going to have to fight against radicals that could soon have the full support of population centres, which will actively seek to protect and defend such terrorists. If we can't wipe them out now, then they could grow even stronger by the day."
 commonwealth.39.o1:0 "Fight harder"
 commonwealth.40.t:0 "Central Committee Attacked"
 commonwealth.40.d:0 "Horrifying news from Philadelphia is reaching the country today. According to broken reports due to a loss of solid communications, the Central Committee Building in our capital has been attacked by multiple terrorists. We don't have an official death toll, but shocking footage has just been released to local news networks of the Capitol exploding in an enormous ball of flames, smoke and debris, with the entire central dome collapsing in on itself and the façade completely obliterated. Until we get those numbers, we could be looking at hundreds of people killed... and not just civilians, but the very members of our government who were attending an emergency Committee session."
 commonwealth.40.o1:0 "Pray for the victims"
 commonwealth.41.t:0 "White Phoenix Revealed"
 commonwealth.41.d:0 "Finally the real 'White Phoenix' has been revealed in an elaborate video broadcast across the nation. Somehow his more 'tech-savvy' followers gained control of every single local news network in the Commonwealth and broadcast the back story and future plans of their 'great leader'. Michael Pence from Columbus Indiana became a Catholic priest not long after the collapse of the United States and his immigration to the American Republic. While living a life of peace however, he became increasingly angry at President Bush's reluctance to invade the Commonwealth and restore his beloved United States, turning to radical politics. At this point in his life he united with a small group of Catholic politicians who believed the only way to restore the old American way was through war with every single nation that broke apart from Reagan's Washington. This clique soon grew into a large faction within the northern American Republic, establishing small militias that would terrorise and sabotage infrastructure or industry past the border. In 2009 Mike Pence went into hiding and was believed by many to have been killed by government agents, but had instead assembled a terrorist army that called themselves the 'Followers of the White Phoenix'. That White Phoenix was Michael Pence, and whatever was going to rise out of the ashes was certainly not the old United States."
 commonwealth.41.o1:0 "We can defeat him"
 commonwealth.42.t:0 "Indiana Rallies Behind Radicals"
 commonwealth.42.d:0 "The state of Indiana is rallying behind terrorists from the South, simply due to the fact that the 'White Phoenix' is a local. Well, at least that's what the official army reports suggest. They have chosen to believe that Governor Davis' murder was justified to prove to the Commonwealth's government that their system was corrupt and 'satanic' as Mike Pence's propaganda states. This could cause a lot of trouble for us in the coming weeks, as at the moment these radicals are not as much a pressing issue as others throughout our Commonwealth. But if more states side with enemies of the state then our very survival is at stake..."
 commonwealth.42.o1:0 "Indiana will face the consequences"
 commonwealth.43.t:0 "Military Commanders Defect"
 commonwealth.43.d:0 "Several military commanders have defected to the Followers of the White Phoenix, despite many not even being Catholic. Leading members of the Central Committee were alerted to this treason early in the morning, awoken by advisors to plan a new course of action involving different commanders that were still loyal to the glorious Philadelphia revolution. This kind of mutiny almost occurred immediately after President Chomsky's impeachment, but generals and admirals were persuaded to remain under our command with reassurances that their beautiful nation would be preserved as it should be with strong revolutionary socialist principles... and that their jobs would not be under any threat. However, it seems growing popular support for Mike Pence has changed their minds, and defection has given the enemy a significant advantage."
 commonwealth.43.o1:0 "Traitors!"
 commonwealth.44.t:0 "Military Reassures Politicians"
 commonwealth.44.d:0 "The many generals and admirals that stood by our side during the defection of their closest colleagues have informed the Central Committee that we can still come back even stronger after this. While several politicians had already expressed their belief that the Commonwealth was doomed to collapse in the coming days and this rebellion would succeed in all its efforts, they were thankfully reassured that such an event would never occur. As long as military leaders had more freedom to conduct operations they deemed viable, no matter the human rights violations or possible war crimes committed, they stated that this rebellion would be crushed in no time."

 commonwealth.45.t:0 "Mike Pence's Forces Grow"
 commonwealth.45.d:0 "Soldiers and civilians are betraying their country to join the Followers of the White Phoenix, who have also allied with various terrorist groups throughout the Commonwealth. Their 'great leader' Mike Pence is seeing his forces grow stronger and larger as every single day passes, offering him a unique propaganda opportunity that has been capitalised on to the fullest extent. If we can't achieve multiple victories against these relentless repulsive terrorists soon, our chances of reconquering lost lands in this war sharply drop. Now is the time for action from both our politicians and the generals they trust!"
 commonwealth.45.o1:0 "Worrying..."
 commonwealth.46.t:0 "Battle of Philadelphia"
 commonwealth.46.d:0 "Enemy of the state Mike Pence has made a daring and perhaps fatal move. Instead of continuing his campaign through rural America and defeating our loyal soldiers in every state, he has chosen to divert a considerable invasion force towards the capital in an attempt to end this war as soon as possible. If he takes control, the country is lost and we have reached the point of no return. But if we can beat back this invasion force and totally crush it, the war may be over in our favour. Now we only have to wait for the final confrontation..."

 commonwealth.47.d:0 "With their victory in Philadelphia, rebel forces have managed to bring down the entire Commonwealth government. Politicians around the country flew out last night in their private planes to allied nations, and others committed suicide upon hearing of defeat in the capital. As this unprecedented surrender occurred, Mike Pence ordered all government buildings to be the focus of rebel units around the country, instead of infrastructure and industry. This has only accelerated the fall of our administration, and it won't be long until the last remnants of Philadelphia's revolutionary socialists have been wiped out."
 commonwealth.47.o1:0 "This is the end"
 commonwealth.48.t:0 "Remaining Urban Areas Seized"
 commonwealth.48.d:0 "Mike Pence's victorious forces have seized all remaining urban areas in the American People's Commonwealth, claiming that any last politicians who had neither committed suicide nor left the country surrendered immediately to invading rebels. While the fall of Philadelphia certainly spelt out the end of our revolutionary socialist government, there were still strongholds throughout the North-East that remained loyal to a fallen government. Now however... it's all over. The Followers of the White Phoenix have officially won this civil war that started out originally as a minor rebellion with little recognition from the nation or international community."

 commonwealth.50.t:0 "A Permanent Flag?"
 commonwealth.50.d:0 "Contrary to popular international belief, the current flag of our Commonwealth is technically a temporary banner that should have been replaced long before the turn of the century. However, political deadlock and President Chomsky's refusal to make any concessions to the Central Committee essentially forced it to become our permanent flag. Now with the former commander in chief out of the picture and the political situation calm, perhaps we should create a permanent banner for our glorious nation..."

In secret negotiations, prominent Philadelphia politicians now out of a job have formed an official alliance with the Commonwealth's Communist Party and organised a large uprising against the commander in chief. At their provisional capital, the rebels and traitors to our revolutionary leftist cause declared Chomsky a failed President, followed by a statement that he must be removed through whatever means necessary. At the moment it seems joining forces with the Communist Party is one of those means..."

The classified documents seem to suggest that Sanders' Chief of Staff and manager of his efficient national campaign to be elected President, stole funds from the Vermont government for his own personal use. While the documents fail to mention what that money was spent on, it does also state that not long after the theft, a new home in Boston was gifted to Mr. Sanders by his Chief of Staff, costing significant amounts of money for a state governor. While this might seem like incriminating information, it could easily be false, and if it is true there is no evidence suggesting that President-elect Sanders had any knowledge of such a crime committed. Perhaps it's best for Gates to let this slide and try not to wonder why someone would give this to him... and who."

What the Chief of the Technology Council found inside shocked him to the core, and not just because of what it suggested... but because of what hard evidence it gave supporting those suggestions. Now the prominent but secluded politician must make the most difficult decision of his life. If he releases these new documents now he runs the risk of being taken out by those who would wish for them to remain hidden, but can he afford to wait that long... when anything could happen. Or perhaps this should be burnt just like those other classified documents."

Upon arrival, they were expecting a new software development or perhaps a pan-council cooperation project between Gates and the Industrial Council. However, what Gates was really there to announce shocked all those around him, the nation and the world. According to these secret documents which were simultaneously released on the internet as Gates spoke, President-elect Bernie Sanders orchestrated the May Day Attacks in New York City. By paying large sums of money to radical terrorist groups, even from around the world, he managed to indirectly train and fund a small elite force to bring down the National Economic Center in a spectacular declaration of war against our Commonwealth. Following these shocking allegations, international media poured over the evidence and concluded that this could all be true, and the man on his way to becoming the most powerful person in the Commonwealth is responsible for the deaths of thousands. The nation is already reeling and our citizens no longer know who to trust."

Supposedly, the intended operation would have involved detonating two dirty bombs in downtown Chicago and Manhattan three years before the tragic 5/1 attack. Local journalists have met with the defectors to discuss their interactions with this agent, where they later mentioned that whoever was behind Operation 'Lake Smoke' aborted just days before it was to take place. There was no reasoning for this sudden cancellation, but they believe it is no coincidence that on the same week, long-time Agricultural Council member Sanders was appointed to become Vermont's next Governor after the suicide of his predecessor."

With his implication in the 5/1 attacks, the beloved president-elect had become the most hated man in the Northeast. The Governor of Pennsylvania attempted to mobilize state police to deal with the rioters, but they were not able to prevent them from setting ablaze the vacated home of the President-Elect and other members of the Central Committee. Despite promises from government officials for a formal prosecution of Sanders’ heinous crimes, mob rule has consumed the capital of the American People’s Commonwealth. Fires of anger will continue to burn throughout Pennsylvania until the traitor is brought to justice."

Spray-painted slogans of cynicism deface the names of those who lost their lives in the attacks on the National Economic Center, now known to be orchestrated by President-Elect Bernie Sanders. The ruined monument of the APC’s unity remains as disunited as the rest of the city. The whistleblower himself, Bill Gates, has retreated behind the black marble walls of the Technology Council Tower, besieged by those who deny the ugly truth. Outside, Sanders supporters hurl threats and obscenities towards “lying Bill” while attempts by security personnel to disperse them have been met with violence. As counter-protestors emerge from state-controlled apartments to drive the mob out, the shadowy streets and overturned taxi cabs of New York City have become the scene of a public battlefield.

For months the people have thrown total support behind their supposedly humanitarian democratic activist, but further revelations from radical terrorists turned defectors broke any belief that Gates' documents could be false. Political offices have been burnt down, businesses looted in enormous riots across the Commonwealth and an attempted terrorist attack against the Central Committee Building put Philadelphia on lockdown.

Noam Chomsky is reportedly furious that this enemy of the state has managed to vanish off the face of the Earth, in a time when our nation needs him in court more than ever. While many presume he immediately fled the Commonwealth following those shocking revelations from Council Chief Bill Gates, some have also begun to suspect that the President-elect committed suicide in order to avoid the wrath of his own people.

According to these documents, trade council chiefs met with Bernie Sanders in various secret meetings that resulted in the later murders of any politician opposed to his plan to overthrow Chomsky's administration. While the exact specific details of these meetings remains unknown, an easy connection of the dots would suggest that the trade councils were now well aware of what was about to take place on May Day, and supported it as long as they were given a vital role in Sanders' new government."

But they could never have expected what came onto these monitors. In this silent but crystal clear footage, Bernie Sanders is pushed into the frame by two masked men and forced to kneel down in front of the camera.

Small business owners have left to start new lives, council chiefs left their administrations in disarray after fleeing the country, and many countries have simply stopped trading with us.

Today I was prepared to make a speech to you that would further ignite our political revolution and show the world that we are unstoppable in our efforts to restore democracy to every forsaken land. But the events that have transpired in this beautiful capital cast a dark and ominous cloud over us. Our most loyal servant, a man of great conviction and love of his work, William Gates, was brutally murdered on these very streets by a gunman who remains hidden from our government. He had done nothing to deserve the wrath of our enemies and yet they saw fit to take another life whenever they pleased. But as we mourn for this hero of the nation, all citizens of the Commonwealth must ask themselves this glaring question. If they will kill an innocent man, then what is stopping them from killing off an innocent nation? This was not a lone assassination. This was a declaration of war against the American People's Commonwealth... a statement from the enemies that have tried to bring us down from the very beginning. If there were a different man standing here today the nation would cower. It would suffer. It would die. But you have placed your trust in me to preserve, protect and defend our Commonwealth, and that is exactly what I will do. As of now, we are at war with the American Republic! And it will not be a war the Commonwealth shall lose. For every man or woman that dies on this future battlefield, another will rise to defend the legacy of William Gates. And in the end... we shall prevail. Long live socialism! Long live the American People's Commonwealth! Long live the people!'"

Today we stand on the brink of a new beginning for our nation. An age of democracy, freedom, the right to be who you want to be... values that have been held back and crushed by a gang of political masterminds here in this very metropolis. But for every crime committed against the American people by this government, there are two committed by our foreign enemies, those who seek to bring down the Commonwealth through whatever means they deem necessary. Murder. War. Manipulation. Corruption. These forces of evil will stop at nothing to see Philadelphia fall into the hands of their beloved President [USA.GetLeader], and yet until this very day it seems not one man or woman has taken action. Politicians sitting in their ivory towers and gleefully observing as the American people do their dirty work, have talked of mediation... of diplomacy and peaceful coexistence. Perhaps in another age when humanity can stand side by side as equals this will be possible. But now is not that age, and now is not the time for discussion. Now... is the time for action. As of now the American People's Commonwealth is at war with the embodiment of inhumanity itself, the Republic. And it will not be a war the Commonwealth shall lose. For every man or woman that dies on this future battlefield, another will rise to defend the legacy of our revolution. And in the end... we shall prevail. Long live socialism!

 commonwealth.74.d:0 "A week after the grand inauguration of our beloved President Bernard Sanders, the nation has mourned in an enormous funeral procession for Technology Council Chief Bill Gates. The prominent politician was gunned down not long before the transfer of power between Chomsky and Sanders was to take place, and it certainly sent shockwaves through the entire Commonwealth. An innocent and reclusive man devoted to his work, brutally murdered by enemies of the state in a direct attack on our country. While it is certainly a horrific event, there is perhaps a lighter side. Millions of Americans flocked to New York just as they did after the May Day attacks in a show of support for President Sanders, the war effort and the legacy of a hard working truly American man. The funeral ended with a long speech from our commander in chief about the fragility of life and irrationality of our rivals."

Upon hearing these words the millions gathered roared in support, proceeded by an overwhelming rendition of Warszawianka, a spontaneous display of unity that has resonated across the nation.

Upon hearing these words the millions gathered roared in support, proceeded by an overwhelming rendition of Yankee Doodle, a spontaneous display of unity that has resonated across the nation.

Upon hearing these words the millions gathered roared in support, proceeded by an overwhelming rendition of My Country Tis of Thee, a spontaneous display of unity that has resonated across the nation.

 commonwealth.82.d:0 "Initially a decree that was swiftly passed by the Central Committee, all national and state flags were to be lowered to half mast after May's tragic terrorist attack. Since then our nation has gone through a time of unity, mourning and combined perseverance, as the odds seemed impossible stacked against us. Nevertheless, the time must eventually come to end the grieving process and start moving onwards, with the first step in that initiative being raising all flags from half mast. Citizens of our Commonwealth are free to maintain their patriotic decorations at half mast, but government institutions, landmarks and anything else associated with the nation's inner workings must raise the flags. It will show to the world that we have managed to come out of 5/1 stronger than ever."

 commonwealth.83.t:0 "Chomsky Implements Direct Democracy"
 commonwealth.83.d:0 "With the old Central Committee removed from its position of power and an anarcho-syndicalist federation of delegates in power, President Chomsky has essentially been reduced to a figurehead. His position as our commander in chief is one only existing to showcase unity and a face to turn to in the toughest of times. Nevertheless, the President still at this time has enormous power within the Central Committee, and is using this for the greater good. Today Noam Chomsky announced that his government would immediately be implementing direct democracy throughout the Federation, demolishing any authoritarian aspects of the old Commonwealth and giving all Americans a say in the political process. This is truly the dawn of a new era for the American people, as old democracy in the United States was simply a feeble attempt at disguising corporatist fascism as 'freedom'."
 commonwealth.83.o1:0 "Democracy lives on!"
 commonwealth.84.t:0 "Free Association Permitted"
 commonwealth.84.d:0 "The Provisional Federation of Delegates has in accordance with the IWW's stance on direct democracy, legalised free association. While there were elements of factionalism in the American People's Commonwealth and moderates were given a voice in local media, every single citizen was forced to either become a member of the IWW's political wing or remain apolitical. Prominent unionists within the Federation have proclaimed their government's official condemnation of such practice, labelling it tyrannical and fascistic in its most basic form. By tomorrow night, the American people will be legally permitted to join any party and associate with any movement they desire."

 commonwealth.85.t:0 "Chomsky Meets Military Leaders"
 commonwealth.85.d:0 "After long consultation sessions with different factions within the Federation of Delegates, President Chomsky has decided to meet with military leaders to discuss a new plan for the armed forces. While many pacifist allies of Chomsky suggested that the army, air force and navy be completely disbanded no matter the cost to both our prestige and ability to defend the Federation, our President quickly declared his opposition. Instead, he decided to moderate between those simply wanting the military to remain as it was under the Commonwealth, and other factions that support a far more limited role. In the end, the plan that Noam Chomsky presented to commanders in Philadelphia detailed a 'military for defence' initiative. This initiative would drastically decrease the military budget and end any training exercises that prepared soldiers for invasion of other nations."
 commonwealth.85.o1:0 "Interesting"
 commonwealth.86.t:0 "Abolition of Wages"
 commonwealth.86.d:0 "During an extraordinary session of the Federation of Delegates, President Chomsky and his allies within the legislative body pushed forward a bill that would abolish wages totally but gradually. Such a proposal so early in the anarcho-syndicalist era of our nation came as a shock to many sitting in their seats, but eventually they became attracted to the points Chomsky and Speaker Germaine Greer presented. Economic, social and political implications were all discussed thoroughly, and while opposition still remained within the room, there was a generally clear consensus among the majority that this bill should be passed. When the time came, only a ninth of the delegates voted against the measure, and wages were officially 'abolished'. Technically, the act of abolition will take place over many years in the future, but this is already a victory for President Chomsky and more radical factions within the Federation."
 commonwealth.86.o1:0 "One giant leap"
 commonwealth.87.t:0 "Chomsky Meets Urban and Rural Delegates"
 commonwealth.87.d:0 "In the past few months, delegates from both urban and rural areas have expressed their dismay at supposed 'neglect' from Philadelphia. Clearly angered by the fact that anyone within his precious utopia could feel sidelined, President Chomsky himself called a meeting of all disgruntled rural and urban federation delegates in the capital. There he reassured them that he was working with every single member of the legislative body to deliver meaningful reforms across the entire country. He couldn't promise everything would come immediately, but the former Commonwealth president and leader of the anarcho-syndicalist movement in America made sure they knew there would be no more neglect coming from Philadelphia in any capacity. It seems the delegates left this meeting happy and certain that their demands would be met."
 commonwealth.87.o1:0 "Ok"
 commonwealth.88.t:0 "Provisional Federation Becomes Permanent"
 commonwealth.88.d:0 "Today the Provisional Federation of Delegates sung their last Warszawianka before officially becoming a permanent legislative and representative body. Domestic and international observers watched from above as President Chomsky signed the bill to dissolve this provisional federation, proceeding to clap ferociously alongside their representatives below. Just over ten speeches from delegates finalised ceremonies and new members who would overtake prominent retiring politicians were sworn in by Speaker Germaine Greer. Finally we have achieved the final goal of our anarcho-syndicalist movement, and the American people can be sure that we are working at our most efficient."

 commonwealth.89.d:0 "Eminent members of the Automotive Council today announced the dissolution of their government body and its replacement by a larger and more representative 'Grand Trade Council'. This new administration shall incorporate current government members, as well as Bill Gates' Technology Council and the small amount of Council leaders that managed to avoid involvement in Bernie Sanders' masterful plan to overthrow President Chomsky. An almost coalition government of the most powerful people in the Commonwealth will seek to work for the people at the greatest rate of efficiency seen in any government in history. At least, that's what Mr. Gates himself said after inviting many local journalists to his home for a press conference concerning the recent developments in Detroit."
 commonwealth.89.o1:0 "Interesting"
 commonwealth.90.t:0 "Central Committee Abolished"
 commonwealth.90.d:0 "By unanimous decree of the Grand Trade Council in its early emergency session, the Commonwealth Central Committee has been officially abolished. No longer shall the Communist agents within our highest legislative body continue to run wild with dissident tactics and threaten our very way of life every single day. Finally the 'New Guard' scourge has been stripped of all its power within the Commonwealth, and soon our nation will be well on its way towards continued prosperity and perhaps eventual unification of the shattered American states. With a rebellious Committee out of the way, the Council's task should be far easier than ever before."
 commonwealth.90.o1:0 "Great"
 commonwealth.91.t:0 "Bill Gates Consolidates Power"
 commonwealth.91.d:0 "President Gates has refused to align himself with any one ideology, rejecting the 'technocratic', 'oligarchic' or 'authoritarian' labels many have begun to call him. Instead, the recently sworn in commander in chief describes his administration as one following the unique 'Gatesist' system, where a small government of scientists, industrial leaders, engineers and prominent foreign policy experts gather to manage a collectivised economy. With many links to the economic system of the Soviet Union and other communist or socialist states around the world, Gates continues to sideline anarchist and syndicalist elements within the old Central Committee which is more than likely soon to be dissolved."
 commonwealth.91.o1:0 "Interesting"
 commonwealth.92.t:0 "Moderates Purged"
 commonwealth.92.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, Bill Gates has used his executive powers to order the purging of all moderates throughout the Commonwealth, declaring them a pest that must be destroyed before it's too late. As thousands of prominent democratic activists, supporters of the old United States and many others were arrested last night, the President has drawn heavy criticism to himself. Some are already making clear links between his government and the totalitarian communist societies of Europe, which famously crushed moderate dissent in the 1980s and 1990s. Nevertheless, while critics continue to blast the commander in chief for removing these pests, his support only continues to grow, as much of the country begins to realise he has saved them from total destruction. And perhaps these 'moderates' never wanted democracy in the first place. After all, it was from their faction that the murderous Bernie Sanders rose up from."
 commonwealth.92.o1:0 "Ok"
 commonwealth.93.t:0 "Capital Moved to New York"
 commonwealth.93.d:0 "Key branches of the Gates government have been moved to New York, with both the legislative and executive sectors now calling the metropolis their home. This comes as the President declared this afternoon that Philadelphia will no longer remain the Commonwealth's capital, as it represented corruption, anarchism and worst of all the possible tyranny that President Sanders could have established in that very city. It may take some time for the general populace to adjust to this change, but eventually they will come to accept that this is not just a symbolic change, but one of common sense. New York is the heart of our industrial might, the cultural capital and birthplace of the modern American dream."
 commonwealth.93.o1:0 "Ok"
 commonwealth.94.t:0 "Gates' Speech on Technology"
 commonwealth.94.d:0 "'Technology Above All' has become the motto of Bill Gates' new ideological movement both within the Commonwealth and abroad. In his unexpected speech to a Rhode Island conference of like-minded self-proclaimed 'Gatesists', the President called for rapid technological advancement at a rate the world has never seen before. He called this the new enlightenment age, one that he would personally lead until he either died or passed the torch onto a successor with 'even greater ambition' than he could possibly dream of. While the speech itself lasted for more than twenty minutes, our leader managed to captivate his audience and further spread the ideals of Gatesism throughout the world by broadcasting this aptly labelled 'technology above all' speech on international platforms. Soon the movement won't just be prominent in the People's Commonwealth, but hopefully in every single nation."

 commonwealth.99.d:0 "With constitutional law requiring at least one member of any national Trade Council to support the commencement of official investigations, John Holdren of the Technology Council rejected Bill Gates' firm policy and called for immediate hearings regarding May's attack. This support gave the Commonwealth Central Committee a mandate to begin unopposed hearings into President Chomsky's conduct both before and after 5/1. With much speculation in Philadelphia circling not just in the local media, but also within the halls of power, prominent New Guard politicians have finally announced that the nation's highest legislative body will start calling for administration officials on both a Commonwealth and state level to step forward and present testimonies. It may be only a matter of days until the first are brought to Philadelphia for questioning, as some officials have already stated that they will gladly head to the capital and defend our commander in chief. The country remains sceptical however of what motives could possibly be behind the Committee's action, and many believe this could be the beginning of their scheme to overthrow Noam Chomsky in a gradual disguised coup. Whatever their motives may be, no one is safe from the wrath of a mob with overwhelming lust for power and revenge."

 commonwealth.100.t:0 "Intelligence Agency Created"
 commonwealth.100.d:0 "During a period of great uncertainty, a group of eminent Committee members today announced that they would be pushing for a bill to establish the Commonwealth's first united intelligence agency. Essentially unable to refuse due to the implication that he was 'once again' neglecting the security of our vulnerable country, President Chomsky signed it just two hours into 'debate' between Central Committee members, who only sought to grandstand against the battered leader. At closing time of today's session, the foundations of a 'People's Defense Service' were established through the passing of this bill, met by a standing ovation from the Central Committee and clear reluctance from President Chomsky who has continued to advocate for more decentralisation throughout his many years of leading this nation. Nevertheless, the Service will surely increase counter-terrorism efforts both at home and abroad, so Americans can finally feel safe in their own cities and homes."
 commonwealth.100.o1:0 "Excellent"
 commonwealth.101.t:0 "Local Media Discredited"
 commonwealth.101.d:0 "Constitutional requirements dictate that there can be no Commonwealth-wide state owned media service, be it newspaper, radio, television or anything else. These restrictions have severely damaged the Central Committee's ability to increase support for its own actions, as the local media of each state is controlled by Old Guard Governors who will stop at nothing to bring down our plans for retaliation against their precious Chomsky. Attempting to take down this institution now would be a foolish move, and would surely seal the Committee's fate as the last to be ruled by opposition to Old Guard ideals. However, a secret 'convention' of like-minded and driven politicians within the legislative body met just a few hours ago to draft a plan that would seek to gradually undermine local media until the general populace view it as corrupt... something that must be eradicated. All those present agreed that this scheme could be successful, proceeding to present it to their colleagues, who also made the same assessment. Soon popular support for a national state-owned media service will be the highest it has ever been, and the Central Committee shall have the mandate it desperately needs."
 commonwealth.101.o1:0 "Intriguing"
 commonwealth.102.t:0 "Media Bill Crushed by President"
 commonwealth.102.d:0 "Public approval of a nationwide state-owned television service among other media alternatives has skyrocketed in recent weeks, ever since the Central Committee went through the motions of undermining local media. Hundreds of journalists have become the target of an overwhelmingly well-funded campaign to discredit them and their work, with average citizens accepting Committee members' 'corruption' and 'fake news' labels. The master stroke of this plan however was yet to be implemented, and only now has the Central Committee decided to strike a fatal blow at the heart of President Chomsky's base of support. This morning all members ensured that they would be in the building and seated before Chomsky had even arrived, portraying him as lazy and neglectful of important political process. The next stage of their plan was to dramatically announce an end to local media dominance, in the form of a constitutional amendment that would permit nationwide broadcasting. The Committee floor erupted in cheers from every side, to the shock and horror of Chomsky and his closest confidants. Naturally in this extraordinary case, the Acting Speaker of the Chamber called for a vote on the amendment, which passed unanimously. Not a single member voted against proposed measures, which made the President's subsequent action even more drastic. After all votes had been counted and the time came for Mr. Chomsky to sign it into law, the President refused, labelling such actions unconstitutional and prematurely cancelled today's Central Committee session. It won't be long until the commander in chief has realised what an impact this one rejection would have on the future of his precious nation."

 commonwealth.103.t:0 "Generals Meet With Committee Leaders"
 commonwealth.103.d:0 "Eminent generals within the army and air force met with senior Central Committee members today to discuss the Commonwealth's future. While there was obviously no overt sinister tone to the meeting, the Old Guard already suspected that it was organised to ensure the military's loyalty to a rebellious Committee. Retired United States Army General James Mattis was invited due to his extremely high popular support within the Commonwealth, but declined and proceeded to meet with local journalists to voice his concerns. According to the famous veteran, this meeting could only mean a civil war was brewing between President Chomsky and the Central Committee, with only one side able to come out on top. If military commanders were brought into the New Guard's fold, there would be no stopping them once they had reached their ultimate potential."

 commonwealth.104.d:0 "Central Committee faction leaders came together today for a joint press conference that highlighted the sharply falling public support for President Noam Chomsky's leadership. While experiencing a high point just after the May Day attack, official investigations into his administration and prior conduct, as well as a terrible strategic move on the Committee floor not long ago, have brought enormous discontent and anger at the commander in chief. If this trend continues he could become even less popular than Ronald Reagan just before the dissolution of the old United States. Reaching that point is still almost impossible, as Chomsky still has the support of many millions who are opposed to a 'coup' by the Central Committee."

Vehemently supporting a drastically expanded plan, representatives of the Philadelphia legislative body successfully pushed for an organisation that would investigate how transportation departments under President Chomsky have combated domestic and foreign terrorism efforts. If the watchdog finds any evidence of wrongdoing, these representatives say there will be severe consequences for every single department and in particular it will place a clear target on the President's back. Managers of the state-owned American Airlines have expressed their concern at this 'watchdog', calling it tyrannical and simply an effort by Philadelphia to curb any influence of the Old Guard in whatever sector they can get their hands on."

He stated in an address at the Legislative Assembly that he has consulted with state construction companies and all other stakeholders, resulting in a 'confirmation' that construction will be complete in four years or less. This ambitious proposal has left many uncertain, but with the foundations being laid in the coming weeks, progress is certainly moving along far quicker than anyone could have expected. If the buildings can be finished in that timeframe, it will be an enormous popularity boost for the young and relatively unknown Governor, as well as his friends in the Central Committee."

Broadcasted live across the nation, the official hearing lasted well into the night, with Committee members relishing in the spotlight as an endless stream of questions or even accusations came pouring out of their mouths. By the end of his questioning, Chomsky was clearly losing patience and ability to remain composed, lashing out at several popular politicians in front of him. While the questioning obviously brought no true results or implicated our leader in any wrongdoing, watching Chomsky gradually fall apart was an experience the Commonwealth will never forgot. Now he is no longer the fierce leader that was called on to lead our nation and has done so effectively since then. Now he is the weak and old President who has been beaten down by younger, more confident and intelligent opponents."

He proceeds to perform various sexual acts with her all recorded in the footage, proceeded by both engaging in illicit drug use ranging from cocaine to marijuana across the entire night. The leaked video lasts from approximately six o'clock to three the next morning, with nine hours of pure sin shown to the entire planet. Politicians in Philadelphia and journalists across the nation awoke unable to comprehend what would follow. But it didn't take long for members of the Central Committee to quickly convene in the capital without their commander in chief to stir up calls for his immediate removal. As internet polls are released to the media, Noam Chomsky is now officially the least popular President of any American nation in history, including those of the United States."

However, with his public approval crashing to its lowest ever and the nation utterly shocked, eminent Old Guard politicians had no choice other than to meet with faction leaders within the Central Committee and work with them to start impeachment proceedings. This morning the Central Committee convened with Chomsky present, sitting at his seat in silence and refusing to make the first speech as he has done during every single session since assuming the Presidency. At this point however, members had completely neglected an integral portion of the following process. Just like any other constitutional amendment, at least one national trade council member's support is required to impeach the President, and unfortunately for the Central Committee, the trade councils had declared their unwavering support for Chomsky in his most dire time. For hours it appeared as though the Commonwealth was heading to a total breakdown until John Holdren of the Technology Council stepped forward and signed a document that would begin an impeachment process. No less than half an hour later, the Central Committee had unanimously voted to impeach President Noam Chomsky with immediate effect, leaving the position of head of state vacant for the time being. As this occured, remaining supporters as well as moderate dissidents, Old Guard leaders and all those opposed to Central Committee rule protested in the streets. Millions of Americans called the impeachment illegitimate, demanding a military coup to remove the Committee from power."

No other leader in our history has perhaps betrayed his own morals for the greater good, or fought against his own allies to secure peace and prosperity for our young nation. It is due to this immense sacrifice and sense of duty that the Commonwealth Central Committee voted yesterday afternoon to elect the shunned Technology Council member as Chomsky's successor and the true American President. As he served us well during those dark times and the even more precarious civil war, he shall continue this legacy into the future as our head of state and commander of the armed forces.

 commonwealth.112.d:0 "Many political commentators within the soon-to-be-dissolved local media speculated that shunned Technology Council member and driving force behind the impeachment of Noam Chomsky, John Holdren, would be appointed President of the American People's Commonwealth. However, yesterday afternoon the Central Committee took drastic actions to never again grant the highest office in the land to one person. Instead, all members decided that the best course of action in these dark times would be to abolish the office of President forever, empowering the Philadelphia legislative body as the supreme rulers of our Commonwealth."
 commonwealth.112.o1:0 "Long live the Central Committee!"
 commonwealth.113.t:0 "Nations Agree to Recognise Commonwealth"
 commonwealth.113.d:0 "For too long the international community has sidelined us as an illegitimate government, with only a handful of socialist nations recognising Philadelphia as the capital of a true successor state to the former American government. Now however, our victory in the disastrous civil war has brought significant attention to our clear superiority and strength compared to rivals in the American Republic and UAPR. While great powers like the Soviet Union have rejected any calls for our membership within the United Nations, many world leaders have just announced that they will formally recognise the American People's Commonwealth as a real sovereign entity. Unfortunately they have also maintained recognition of either the Atlanta or Los Angeles administrations, but this is still a great leap forward in our quest for American reunification."
 commonwealth.113.o1:0 "Wonderful"
 commonwealth.114.t:0 "Commonwealth Embassies Established"
 commonwealth.114.d:0 "Representatives of the Central Committee met with Ambassadors from around the world today, from nations that have only just recognised the APC as a legitimate entity. While their entire discussions were private, there has been a significant development in our foreign relations with the international community. In the spirit of greater cooperation and world peace, Commonwealth embassies will be established around the world, and Ambassadors representing Philadelphia will be selected as soon as possible. Finally we have the means to work with other countries that may have before rejected any notion of peaceful coexistence between us and them."
 commonwealth.114.o1:0 "Ok"

 commonwealth.115.d:0 "This is a momentous day not just for the people of our country, but the entire planet. In an extraordinary congress of the Geneva General Assembly, United Nations members voted overwhelmingly to accept us into the international organisation. While we had passed this first stage of membership, the Security Council was yet to vote on the issue, and every single spectator believed without a doubt that the vetoes from Warsaw Pact allies would render that General Assembly vote invalid. However, it seems [SOV.GetLeader] is not as intelligent as he tries to appear. Instead of shutting down any possibilities of a Commonwealth in the UN, he pulled out from the vote and ordered all allies to follow. Apparently they assumed this would create chaos within the Security Council, resulting in other nations to abstain from the vote after the world's greatest superpower dropped out. This was not the case. At 1:04 PM this afternoon the United Nations Security Council officially accepted Commonwealth membership in the organisation."

 commonwealth.116.d:0 "The 'Socialist Trading Network' is an initiative crafted by elite members of the Central Committee, who called for such an organisation to be created even during President Chomsky's catastrophic reign. At the time it was seen as an impossibility in our modern world, but the Philadelphia Central Committee voted quite heavily in favour of its establishment at its morning session, labelling the initiative a 'detailed and intricate solution to the planet's economic woes'. According to several government sources and suggested in party announcements from the capital, the Socialist Trading Network will link all revolutionary socialist nations of the world into a single economic program, encouraging trade and freedom of movement for state-owned corporations within each member state."

 commonwealth.117.t:0 "American Peace Act"
 commonwealth.117.d:0 "With the full support of key Old Guard figures and every single state Governor, Noam Chomsky has signed into law the American Peace Act, in the face of strong opposition from Philadelphia's Central Committee. This executive order will allow all decentralised state intelligence services to investigate faction leaders and members of the authoritarian New Guard. Naturally there was immense outcry against the new measures implemented by both democratic activists and supporters of the Central Committee, a highly unusual alliance. However, opinion polling in various states shows that the majority of the Commonwealth's populace fully support Chomsky's American Peace Act, considering most Committee members traitors to the 1988 revolution. If subsequent investigations stemming from the executive order find any evidence of corruption within our highest legislative body, it will ensure the President has a mandate to exercise his ultimate power over a rebellious New Guard."
 commonwealth.117.o1:0 "There will be hell to pay"
 commonwealth.118.t:0 "Crackdown on Committee Rebellion"
 commonwealth.118.d:0 "Investigations authorised by the recently legislated American Peace Act have found evidence of corruption within the Central Committee and a small but growing conspiracy to overthrow President Chomsky through illegal methods. Finally the commander in chief has discovered his opportunity to crackdown on Committee rebellion, a victory that he has attempted to blow upon his enemies since the very beginning. Late last night, members implicated in the aforementioned investigation were rounded up by state government police and immediately arrested to eventually be trialed by the Supreme Court, a selection of staunch Old Guard allies. Hours later Noam Chomsky called an emergency party congress in Philadelphia to discuss these revelations, where he proceeded to unleash another fiery tirade that drew more shocked faces from the targeted members."
 commonwealth.118.o1:0 "Ok"
 commonwealth.119.t:0 "Communist Party Banned"
 commonwealth.119.d:0 "From the glorious revolution of 1988 to the late months of 1999, the Communist Party of the American People's Commonwealth was totally banned. Any members not hidden from Philadelphia were imprisoned, exiled or managed to escape on their own to the UAPR. In President Chomsky's 'Millennium Plan' however, he intended to restore many democratic institutions that he believed had been crushed by the initial revolution. As part of this plan, the prominent anarcho-syndicalist signed an executive order that lifted this ban and freed all political prisoners that associated with the Communist Party. The one catch that Central Committee members demanded in order to ensure their support for the executive order, was a ban on the Party engaging in any political office activities. This meant that Communists could associate freely and campaign for their movement among many other activities, but could never ascend to state or national government in any capacity. Such a situation has remained the status quo since 2000, but the CPAPC has grown once again to become a legitimate threat. In an unofficial alliance with various totalitarian Committee members, party officials have conspired to bring down the President through whatever unholy unity became necessary. It is due to this unsettling conspiracy that President Noam Chomsky reversed his Millennium Plan indefinitely at the first Committee session today, banning the Communist Party entirely."
 commonwealth.119.o1:0 "Good riddance"
 commonwealth.120.t:0 "Chomsky Gains More Powers"
 commonwealth.120.d:0 "For probably not the first time in our nation's history, state Governors and trade council chiefs united to threaten the entire Central Committee. In secret consultations with members, the Old Guard leaders suggested that any actions against the President in today's vote would be seen as an act of betrayal, and they would subsequently be removed from their elite positions in Philadelphia and sidelined as outcasts of the Commonwealth. The upcoming vote of course, was one that would amend the 1990 constitution to expand Noam Chomsky's powers. From now on he would essentially rule by decree with little advice from the only legislative body that was specifically designed to advise him on every single issue of the day. This however would not be an issue, as one of the many powers granted would allow the commander in chief to create a cabinet of his own, filled with loyalists from around the Commonwealth. In any other situation the Committee would never accept such measures, but at this point believed the political loss from more powers granted to Chomsky were insignificant compared to the loss of their jobs at the hands of a bloodthirsty Old Guard. The constitutional amendment passed unanimously."
 commonwealth.120.o1:0 "Excellent"
 commonwealth.121.t:0 "Committee Members Express Anger"
 commonwealth.121.d:0 "Several speeches the President made to conferences around the Commonwealth have provoked Committee members into verbal attacks on Chomsky himself. On local media, New Guard elites were surprisingly given a mouthpiece to voice their severe disgust at suggestions made by their supposed national representative and father of the nation. While initially beginning as sincere comments conerning the many conferences, they quickly devolved into tirades against Chomsky once members realised they finally had gained the place to do it. For too long local media had neglected Philadelphia representatives due to journalists being directly controlled by Old Guard state Governors. Unfortunately for these happy politicians, this was exactly what the President had expected. While the commander in chief portrayed himself as a strong, stable and composed leader, Central Committee members looked exhausted, desperate and complaining to a national audience."
 commonwealth.121.o1:0 "The plan worked"
 commonwealth.122.t:0 "Chomsky Meets Moderate Governors"
 commonwealth.122.d:0 "At this precarious point in our political history, Noam Chomsky has decided to meet with moderate Governors of specific states within the Commonwealth. These leaders are aligned with the Old Guard faction but vehemently oppose many of its socialistic policies, instead advocating for a return to republican federal democracy. This move has drawn outrage from many loyal anarcho-syndicalists who believed their President would refuse to cooperate with anyone outside the far left spectrum, but it has also attracted significant support from the President's opponents. Details of each meeting are yet to be revealed, but we can speculate that when his media representatives do release transcripts that the President and Governors would have had long chats about the future of this country... and how the Central Committee must be stopped in its quest for power through whatever means necessary."
 commonwealth.122.o1:0 "Hopefully they agree"
 commonwealth.123.t:0 "Governors Rally Behind President"
 commonwealth.123.d:0 "Some unlikely advocates for the commander in chief have come out in full support of President Noam Chomsky. These few state Governors stated in separate announcements to local media that their meetings were productive, helpful and will lead to greater cooperation between the executive branch and respective administrations. This comes as a relief to the exhausted President, who has been campaigning for the last few weeks to gain support from moderate Governors. Nevertheless, while this has certainly united more Americans behind their President, Committee loyalists are only going to be more enraged by this unholy alliance between the most prominent anarcho-syndicalist of the new millennium and a group of activists demanding the return of their old United States."
 commonwealth.123.o1:0 "Ok"
 commonwealth.124.t:0 "New York Governor Fired"
 commonwealth.124.d:0 "Exercising his extraordinary powers as President of the American People's Commonwealth, Noam Chomsky has suddenly fired New York Governor Bill de Blasio, after extensive consultation with trade councils and representatives from the state itself. This comes as criticisms of the Governor mounted after his extended vacation in Bhutan, which many say was a waste of taxpayers' money and delayed a united response to May Day's attack. With a furious Governor removed from his once secure office, the New York Trade Council representatives, with one seat in every national representative body must appoint a successor. In most states where the incumbent leader is only removed from office when their term expires and not due to a scandal such as in this situation, a successor has already been preselected by the Governor themselves. But because de Blasio is hardly far into his term as the state leader, it is up to this convention of trade council members to decide who takes charge of the Commonwealth's most powerful state."

Treating all people, no matter their race, their colour, their stature in life with respect and with dignity. Now here is my point.\n\nSome of you may agree with me and some of you may not. But in my view, it would be hard for anyone in this room today to make the case that the American People's Commonwealth, a country that all of us love, that we are a just society... or anything resembling a just society today. In the Commonwealth today there is massive injustice in every sense of the word... it is rampant. We live, and I hope all of you know this, in the wealthiest country on the American continent. But most Americans don't know that, because almost all of that wealth and income is going to the elites in Philadelpha, New York, Chicago and every single Trade Council that leeches off our citizens. Now that's the truth. We are living at a time where a handful of people have political power behind comprehension, giving them the ability to maintain tyrannical control over every aspect of our society for the rest of the Commonwealth's history. But at the very same moment, there are millions of people who are struggling to feed their families. They are struggling to put a roof over their heads. They are struggling to find a place in our beautiful Commonwealth. And yet with all that power concentrated in each metropolis, the elites do nothing. This is why we as a united American populace must begin the new political revolution!'"

 commonwealth.126.t:0 "Support for Democracy Grows"
 commonwealth.126.d:0 "It is no longer moderate Governors in the Commonwealth showing overwhelming support for democracy in our nation, as opinion polls show public disapproval of centralised socialism has skyrocketed in recent weeks. Bernie Sanders' speech in Boston on justice, inequality and political concentration seems to have struck a chord with the general populace, as unprecedented crowds head around the country to offer their support for a new political revolution. According to local media Sanders is now the second most popular Commonwealth politician behind Noam Chomsky, immediately granted this approval and an enormous platform through that one address."

 commonwealth.127.t:0 "Bernie Sanders Resigns as Governor"
 commonwealth.127.d:0 "While not necessary to run for national political office, Bernie Sanders has suddenly tendered his resignation to Vermont's representatives in each trade council, who subsequently but reluctantly accepted. The state's beloved leader can no longer unite them against common enemies and in particular defend Vermont as spectacularly as he did against the infamous insurgency not long ago. However, the resignation comes as an enormous popularity boost for the rising star in American politics, showing to the general populace that he is willing to sacrifice everything to commit to his 'political revolution' and fight to the figurative death. Some political commentators on the other hand, loyal to Old Guard opponents of the democratic progressive, call this a political stunt orchestrated by Sanders' campaign team to deliver maximum results across the board. Whatever the case, this has certainly struck a major blow to not just the Central Committee but also to President Chomsky who is currently remaining silent on the rapidly rising popularity of Bernie Sanders."
 commonwealth.127.o1:0 "Interesting"
 commonwealth.128.t:0 "Sanders Meets Conservatives"
 commonwealth.128.d:0 "Bernie Sanders has held a meeting with prominent conservatives within the Commonwealth who aim to restore the United States under a less corrupt system and with more direct democracy. Despite his advocacy for extremely progressive ideas, Sanders has in the past stated his willingness to work with all legitimate parties in order to find the most practical solution. And by working with conservatives on the issue of democracy, this is the perfect opportunity for him to show the nation that his 'values' can truly be put into practice when the time comes. It's a stark contrast to Noam Chomsky who refuses to cooperate with advocates for the capitalist economic system."
 commonwealth.128.o1:0 "Ok"

Such a situation has remained the status quo since 2000, but Bernie Sanders intends to change that.

 commonwealth.130.t:0 "Bernie Appointed to Committee"
 commonwealth.130.d:0 "After a series of negotiations between Vermont representatives and politicians on a national level, the trade councils have decided to appoint Bernie Sanders as a member of the Central Committee. Those in support of the revolutionary voted in favour of his membership due to their belief that he would over time expand influence within Philadelphia and eventually be selected as Noam Chomsky's successor. Opponents that still voted in favour, on the other hand, assume that granting him a fancy title within our nation's highest legislative body will appease him... and the rough unpredictable national political process will wear down this measly state worker. No one at this moment knows what Sanders' true plans are within the Committee, but opponents shouldn't be so sure of his weakness within a different environment."

 commonwealth.131.t:0 "Factional Divide Deepens"
 commonwealth.131.d:0 "A decades-long factional divide between the Old Guard and New Guard has deepened in recent weeks, as state governors and trade council chiefs use local media to direct their insulting comments at Central Committee members, and those same members use the chamber floor to blast prominent opposition figures. This rift between the two main ideologies within our Commonwealth has brought a shocking drop of support for both parties in the issue. Public approval at this point for the Central Committee as a whole stands at just over twenty-five percent, while popularity of Old Guard members has dropped to its lowest ever percentage of forty-one. This worsening rift has granted recently appointed member Bernie Sanders an unprecedented opportunity to overthrow the political establishment and present himself as the stable... more bipartisan choice in this mess."

 commonwealth.132.t:0 "Sanders Creates Socialist Party"
 commonwealth.132.d:0 "Standing at the chamber podium for the very first time in his career, Bernie Sanders made an entirely unexpected announcement, catching fellow members as well as the presiding President off guard. 'In the name of democracy' and 'a new socialist identity', the prominent moderate politician from Vermont officially created his own party to be represented in the Central Committee chamber. This 'Commonwealth Socialist Party' is supposedly a big-tent political organisation aimed at uniting those in support of many current economic policies, but vehemently in opposition to authoritarianism and the trade council system. This will be the first time since the signing of the 1990 constitution that a party other than the political wing of the IWW has held a seat within the Committee. Despite this peculiar situation, there is nothing constitutionally stopping Sanders from creating his own party and rebelling against the organisation he once called home."

While the Committee loyalists' form of revolutionary socialism certainly isn't compatible with communism as a whole, these volunteers feel as though it is their duty to stop the spread of democracy and capitalism, represented by the rise of the American Commonwealth. If this means allying with Philadelphia, then that is what they must do. This honourable act will certainly not go unrecognised by our leaders once the catastrophic war is concluded soon."

Seen as potential allies of the moderate rebellion, it had become necessary for these traitors to be put in their place. Now we have total access to the national council's records and plans for the industrial future of Chomsky's Commonwealth, which were locked away after Central Committee members spectacularly impeached the long-time President. Through these documents we can continue the work of the Industrial Council, without having to weave through the bureaucracy and treachery."

 commonwealth.135.t:0 "Trade Councils to be Executed"
 commonwealth.135.d:0 "While officially in support of the Central Committee during a terrible civil war, many within the administration suspected that all national trade councils were secretly conspiring against the Commonwealth. With their immense political power and hidden wealth, the groups of elite Old Guard politicians could aid rebel efforts to bring down Philadelphia and create a new order led by moderate traitors and the councils themselves. Nevertheless, whatever efforts they went to in order to behind our backs and betray the revolution, we were victorious in the war. As such the time has come to punish such dissident actions with the Commonwealth's harshest possible penalty. As of noon tomorrow, every single member of the national trade councils will be executed by firing squad, starting with the Technology Council in New York state and Agriculture Council in New England."

No longer shall these traitors within our midst conspire to destroy law and order in the name of 'syndicalism'. No longer shall they seek to undermine an efficient and seamless form of governance. Finally those loyal to the Central Committee's vision can rest easy knowing that the last obstacle in our quest for a true American socialist revolution has been conquered. Thousands stood outside Philadelphia's large assembly building, cheering on as prominent Committee members stepped outside to make a short announcement regarding the vote."

They seem to believe that the Central Committee is going through emotions to purge them from this Commonwealth, supported by secret meeting transcripts delivered by anonymous sources. In turn our own unknown sources reported directly back to us to deliver the news that our true internal rivals are prepared for an unprecedented purge of anti-American traitors, and could be ready to leave the country at a moments notice. Hopefully we can catch them at the right time before they leave on a jet plane for some elitist capitalistic hellhole in South America... or maybe Australia. Who knows?"

Those who put up a struggle were executed on the spot without hesitation, their traitorous blood seeping into the bedsheets or perhaps pooling on hard wood floors. Whatever the outcome in each individual house, members of the faction have been sent a clear message. Run while you still can, or the Committee's full might will be unleashed upon traitors to the revolutionary socialist vision. The Philadelphia intelligence agency has confirmed that two political representatives from Connecticut and allies of the abolished Cultural Council left early in the morning via a private jet at Bradley International Airport."

After a lengthy debate between members that lasted many hours, and interrupted by several meetings of faction leaders, the Committee declared that it would officiall condemn the Soviet world order and Moscow's form of communism. This comes despite Communist volunteers fighting on our side during the civil war, but this has been disputed by several Committee members who claim that the volunteers were in fact members of the IWW. While this simply goes against every single document regarding those troops and blatantly disregarding their own words at the time, the American populace has let this slide."

Despite outcry from members of that very advisory legislative body, Chomsky is constitutionally permitted to temporarily cease their duties at any time he wishes. However in the past our long-time commander in chief wouldn't have dared to dissolve the Philadelphia committee, as public approval of members was too high, almost certainly resulting in a subsequent impeachment of a 'trigger-happy' President. Committee members left the capital furious, blaming Old Guard faction leaders for a conspiracy against the 'legitimate' Commonwealth government, as well as local media for slandering them at every possible moment."

Instead of attempting to cooperate with local governments to work towards a moderated solution, the aforementioned activists believe there is only one path towards restoration of the United States of America and a democratic progressive government. They call it the new political revolution, and while it doesn't condone physical violence against opponents, it is certainly a movement of significant verbal violence. Syndicalists, anarchists, Committee allies and many other revolutionary socialists are seen as enemies of the new 'uprising', and these activists will stop at nothing to get their savior Bernie into the nation's highest office... as long as it doesn't involve fighting between fellow Americans."

Their relatively unknown replacements are democratic activists from Boston, radical and unwavering supports of Bernie Sanders. Such a move by an Old Guard state Governor has shocked much of the Commonwealth, as this amount of USA restorationists is the most that have ever held seats within the Central Committee. If a trend continues of representatives replacing members in Philadelphia, moderates could dominate the advisory body and influence a new Presidential election within the chamber."

 commonwealth.144.t:0 "Bernie Sanders Elected President"
 commonwealth.144.d:0 "In the past few weeks state Governors have surprisingly replaced their representatives in Philadelphia with strong allies of Vermont revolutionary Bernie Sanders, perhaps not so coincidentally after lengthy meetings with the man himself. As a result of this swift transition of power between the New Guard factions and a rising modern democratic coalition, the new Central Committee has just elected a new Commonwealth President. To the surprise of the entire nation, members were called for an emergency session without Noam Chomsky present this morning. In the session, more than half of the chamber demanded a fresh leadership election, an act they had refrained from until holding the balance of power. Eventually the Acting Speaker was forced to officially call for the vote to commence, much to the confusion between anger and joy of New Guard faction members. While this vote would surely mean the end of President Chomsky, it would also seal the fate of revolutionary socialists as a dying force. Their fears were proven less than thiry minutes later, as the last ballots were counted and Vermont representative Bernie Sanders won the election. Noam Chomsky now remains a lame duck President, pending the former's future inauguration."

But as the dominant force within our new political climate it is of course inevitable that they must either amend the constitution to fit Gatesist ideology or enforce legislation from the Chomsky era. Today Bill Gates left the Council to debate on the issue of media freedoms within the new Commonwealth, resulting in a ferocious argument concerning the costs and benefits of upholding current media freedoms. Finally once the debate had concluded, it was confirmed by each member that the Technology Council in its unique position, would uphold media freedoms as long as it remained in power with the full support of President Gates. The commander in chief himself agreed with this position, stating to local journalists that this would solidify the Commonwealth's position as a significant bastion of freedom within America's broken states."

Germaine Greer and the President co-sponsored a bill that would officially recognise the independence and right to sovereignty of every continental nation in the former United States. Initially the Federation's position on this issue was unconditional rejection of any international recognition, but this has placed us into a precarious spot in the global community. It was seen as hypocritical by many for us to not recognise these peaceful nations and still demand membership within the United Nations and community as a whole. Thankfully through the chamber's vote today, more than a hundred countries around the planet have agreed to recognise the Federation of American Syndicates as the true successor government to the former American People's Commonwealth."

Seen by most as the father of modern linguistics, the President called for a World Conference just a month ago and finally the day has come to convene it. From all around the world those either simply interested in the field of study, up to the most eminent linguists arrived in Philadelphia for the Commonwealth's first event of its kind. The Conference opened with a speech from Chomsky himself, who thanked everyone for coming and proceeded to detail his history in the science and how he gradually became not just a prominent figure but eventually the political leader of a pre-collapse movement. For most in the room the conference wasn't just about linguistics, but was also an unprecedented vision into Noam Chomsky's life after ascension to the Presidency, due to the commander in chief's continuing reclusion when not in the capital.

The popular media personality was criticised by various state administration officials for labelling the Governor and her allies in the Central Committee as 'a gang of self-absorbed mini-Stalins', a statement that brought her significant praise from fellow entertainers across the country. Yesterday her social media account was suspended for undisclosed reasons, followed by a letter from the Governor herself warning Selah that further pro-terrorist activities would be met with harsh consequences. Pittsburgh's favourite however refused to cooperate, following up on her previous statements by bringing in a fellow anti-Philadelphia activist on her radio show. The two discussed current government policy and the influence of New Guard faction members on supposedly independent local administrations. This once again brought upon her the wrath of Rampollo, signing an order that would legally cease all of Selah's operations with immediate effect. Supporters of the radio former Minneapolis native protested against the move both on social media and in the streets, chanting 'Mini Stalins' in unison."

On display is the full authoritarian potential of each state government, forgotten for many years as no entertainers or political activists have dared to insult leaders since a harsh crackdown in Ohio gave birth to stronger regulations in every single Commonwealth state. Now however, opponents and supporters of the constitutional powers of Pennsylvania Governor Jennifer Rampollo are debating across the state as to whether the powers themselves should even exist. For both factions within the Central Committee this is a pivotal issue. On the one hand, the New Guard explicitly advocates for authoritarian measures to crackdown on dissent within the Commonwealth, but retaining these constitutional powers would give that strength to Old Guard state administrations. With almost no limits, Governors could shut down pro Central Committee sentiment within their own states."

 commonwealth.156.d:0 "The Commonwealth Supreme Court in Philadelphia is the highest judicial court in the land, open to all citizens who feel as though they are facing injustice. It's most notable use is the ability to interpret 1990's constitution and deem actions by either state governments or the national administration as constitutionally acceptable or not. Today, Pittsburgh radio host and activist Lula Selah has taken the issue and subsequent political debate concerning abuse of powers to the Supreme Court. On the building's steps she declared what Rampollo had done was simply unacceptable, and the Commonwealth constitution would be on her side as it should be for every citizen. It was hours until she exited the building for the first time in her life, but Selah appeared in good spirits and more than likely was certain that the Court would stick by her against Pennsylvania's government. Many both in the state and outside however are sceptical, as various clauses within the national constitution do allude to this not at all being an abuse of power. In fact, it is believed that the Governor could have enacted far worse punishments for her arch-nemisis radio host."

There is no mention of protection for citizens against these consequences in the 1990 constitution, and there is an abundance of clauses that ensure each state Governor is legally able to ban Americans from 'inciting disharmony'. Lula Selah left the building in tears, unable to speak to journalists waiting on the steps and refused to comment on the matter hours later. It seems the unexpected result has shattered her will to continue fighting against the state government, also shown by her many supporters suddenly losing an intense fervor that had strengthened her position before the historic ruling. Pennsylvania's Rampollo is reportedly glad that the highest judicial body in the Commonwealth supported her actions, but officially stated that this was the expected result... and that the Governor never for one second believed her ban was constitutionally illegal."

For example, if [Root.GetLeader] were to suffer from an injury that requires immediate transplant, the President would be placed at the top of the list above every other patient. Supporters of the bill state that it maintains stability and prevents the death of 'unifying figures' like the President or trade union organisers. Opponents however label it the death of anarcho-syndicalist thought within the Federation, and will bring us right back to square one in terms of social progress. After Speaker Greer publicly criticised the proposed Healthcare Act, she nevertheless called for a vote in the Federation of Delegates as soon as possible."

Therefore Chomsky was swiftly admitted to a local hospital, pending a transplant for vital organs.

Leaving the country waiting in fear, a spokesperson from the hospital finally came out to meet with tired media in the dead of night to confirm that their transplant was successful. President Noam Chomsky is alive and recovering, having avoided a life-threatening heart attack that could have occurred if the American Healthcare Act had not ensured he would receive the necessary medical care.

Eventually after almost a week, a spokesperson from the hospital came out to meet with tired media in the dead of night to confirm that he had suffered a fatal heart attack hours before.

As a unifying force to bring together the Delegates as well as the people in desperate times, Chomsky served this purpose with unwavering loyalty. Speaker of the Federation Germaine Greer, who is seen by many as the de facto President at this time despite Chomsky having transferred power to the delegates, has herself refused to comment on a possible second convention.

Many have refrained from celebrating this historic event however, as the dark spectre of President Chomsky's death still hangs over the Federation. Most of the country still mourns the loss of their great revolutionary leader, a love that can hardly be seen in any other socialist nation in the modern world.

The first four would be placed on a ballot in three days, and if none gained a majority of votes the second four would be put forward the following day. This process would continue until one candidate managed to claim victory. Many are extremely critical of Greer's method however, labelling it confusing, unnecessary and ridiculous.

Her strongest opponent for the womens' vote is Valeria Wasserman, wife of Noam Chomsky since early 2011, who has frequently called for a weaker Presidency. Third on the ballot is Robin Hahnel, a prominent economist and professor who has turned to politics in recent years. He claims to represent a faction of the Federation intent on saving our environment. Seen as a dark horse for this election, Norman Spinrad is last on the first ballot.

This has created a political vacuum in Philadelphia, with opponents of the office itself gaining traction against those who continue to believe there should be an American President. If the de facto 'leader' of our Federation can't make a decision herself at this pivotal moment, this could become the standard political climate.

Surprisingly for the relatively anti-socialist commander, Mattis declared his loyalty to the birth state of Washington, despite it being known as a new heartland for the revived Communist Party. However, his plans to serve Washington Governor Booth Gardner in his new office of President fell short when the UAPR incorporated his state into 'Columbia' with immediate effect. Mattis was forced to flee the communist conglomerate, attempting to return to recently inaugurated President Bush's American Republic, but was subsequently expelled once again for his refusal to commit to the then-VP's 'vision'. Seemingly with nowhere else to turn to, President Noam Chomsky heard of the General's plight and personally invited him to live in the Commonwealth where he would be accepted with pride. Despite his anti-socialist tendencies, Mattis gladly accepted and gradually became a cult figure within the country. After retiring from military service in the early 2000s, he remained isolated in his Maine home until Germaine Greer's staff called him to action once again."

Even her factional friends however are concerned, being opponents of military strength and influence within any levels of government, especially in the significant role of head of state.

The retired General's address to the nation on that podium captivated our populace, as he spoke of uniting a lost nation, protecting the ideals of anarcho syndicalism, peace in the modern world and defence of our Federation whenever the moment might arise.

Whether this is true or not will surely be uncovered by the appropriate authorities, but the Agricultural Council's legitimacy has certainly been placed into question. Currently the people are asking: 'Where did the money go?'"

And they have certainly delivered, as the city's skyline features a sleek new addition that all but goes above and beyond in terms of tributes. An enormous memorial center underground details the history of the old National Economic Center, from its years in the United States as the World Trade Center, a significant role in the 1987 protests against President Reagan and subsequent symbol of socialist prosperity after the 1988 revolution."

While there are some minor adjustments that are yet to be touched on by the media, the most noticeable and publicised is a change to discourse concerning the old Confederacy. This one council member and some supporters outside the organisational body believe the current curriculum enforces a completely biased view against the Confederate States, labelling it an 'evil fascist slave state'.

A raging fire had consumed much of the building for around ten minutes until it spectacularly exploded with witnesses observing from a safe vantage point, concerned that Detroit Fire weren't anywhere to be seen. As of now police are unable to confirm a cause for the fire and subsequent explosion, and even if it was arson there are no suspects currently in custody according to the city's Police Chief.

Unfortunately, the explosion two nights ago released extremely dangerous toxins into Detroit, almost certainly the cause for the successive illnesses of various journalists to first report at the scene. Some hospitals have already taken in witnesses from that night who have reported queasiness, vomiting and other symptoms, but the city's Health Secretary has refused to declare a health emergency at the time being. According to her, this is merely a contained situation in which witnesses from the scene and emergency services will be treated at local hospitals."

Two days ago she refused to label this for what it was, but at the time there had been no casualties and the situation seemed to be under control. At this point however there is a severe risk to the people of Detroit, as the now cold residents can prove, and the Mayor is reportedly not taking any risks in his precarious position. Local hospital representatives tried to enforce an environment of calm during a bizarre press conference that ended in a spokesperson vomiting over several journalists, but the public is not convinced of their own safety."

One of those bringing up the number of casualties to nine, was the son of a Vermont Governor and predecessor to Bernie Sanders, who infamously orchestrated a purge of all moderate opposition within his own state. After the declaration of a city-wide health emergency and these subsequent tragic deaths, it's highly likely that the central government in Philadelphia will send aid to the grief-stricken and naturally concerned city. Vermont Governor Sanders has finally commented on the situation after the son of his family's executioner passed away, calling for direct aid to be immediately sent in order to help all those affected."

Since then prominent figures from around the country have poured into Detroit to pay respects to fallen citizens, who were simply living out their lives when a sudden accident crushed them forever. The funeral service ended with a speech from the Health Secretary, who announced her resignation on the podium and essentially blamed these deaths on her reluctance to declare a health emergency sooner."

While the media speculates about a killer in McConnellsburg, country police are attempting to piece together who murdered these innocent tourists whilst on their post-graduation trip to our country.

The Pennsylvania trade unions have brushed aside such rumours, and in particular the claims of Fulton's sheriff, who remains a staunch opponent of Philadelphia's interference in local affairs.

This is why many fear the worst, believing that he has been murdered by the same person who killed those innocent tourists, while the more conspiracy-inclined populace indicating to local media that it was Commonwealth police doing the dirty work to avoid opposition within the county.

Naturally officials from Philadelphia have explicitly denied allegations, calling such protesters ridiculous conspiracy theorists who need to think before they speak. These comments unfortunately only worsened the situation, with even more coming out on the streets hours later to protest against indifference and neglect from the state government itself.

The Sheriff's son has refused to take any calls from local media and the local town is clearly distraught upon hearing of their beloved chief murdered just days after he was last seen working in the county seat. Some who were protesting days ago against the government's supposed 'abduction' seem to have changed their mind today, strongly believing that despite Philadelphia's injustices it wouldn't do anything so inhumane to a fellow citizen... let alone a public servant like the County Sheriff."

It appears to represent a stylised version of the letters 'F' and 'W' for Fire Warden, the county terror's chosen title.

People are beginning to suspect that they were themselves killed in the Buchanan fire after burning ten victims to death, or possibly committed suicide not long after. Clearly the 'Fire Warden' was a deranged individual, so the latter suspicion is one not devoid of reason.

Which is why on this great day of celebration for the world, I am forced to find the most pressing complication. And at this point I believe it lies in the Commonwealth itself. Since the revolution of 1988 we have taken great strides in national social and economic development, forging the American People's Commonwealth into an industrial superpower unmatched by most around the planet. And yet in that same time frame the political deadlock strangling Philadelphia has remained, unresolved for too long and causing distress for all Americans who wish to see a government working in their favour. As your President I cannot promise the great political reforms of past years, as it is my firm belief that the revolutionary period is long gone. We as a country are settling into normalcy, and yet Philadelphia has failed to move along with every other hard working citizen. So this year my New Year address is not directed at the millions watching from their television seats. I am speaking straight to the heart of American injustice, those who seek to bring down my Presidency and everything it stands for... at the expense of the average family they see as 'below them'.

The father himself took up arms alongside a syndicalist militia in 1987 to quell the chaos in New York City caused by the fall of the old United States and said that his son was inspired by his own service and felt obliged to serve the commonwealth too one day, eventually joining the Commonwealth Liberation Army's reconnaissance corps in 2008, serving up until he was KIA.

Citing that her tenure was built on revolutionary zeal left behind by President Sanders, rather than a legitimate mandate from the people, Sotomayor announced she would step down as leader of the party. Despite cries from her party begging her to stay, Sotomayor has refused to stay for another term repeatedly stating that Sanders and herself were not elected officials and therefore had no further mandate to lead the nation. With the loss of Sotomayor, the mother of the revolution, the Socialist Party will now begin the task of searching for a new candidate to represent the moderate left of the Commonwealth. However, with this loss, and the election fast approaching, many wonder if the Socialist party will be able to maintain its position as leaders of the nation or if another party will snatch the election now that the revolution against the Central Committee’s tyranny has been won."

Ralph Nader promises more reforms to make the government work for the people by eliminating bureaucratic shortcomings and improving efficiency in delivering the party’s promised reforms. Elaine Bernard wishes for the government to take more steps to ensure gender equality, by amending the constitution to enshrine equality-based laws. Finally, Russ Feingold proposes a more moderate platform to reach across the aisle and keep the Socialist Party in government.

Opposing the policies of the Socialist Party and the Democratic Alliance, the Unity for America Party aims to appeal to thousands of voters who wish to see a moderate America return to the forefront rather than have the nation soiled and moved too far into the wrong direction.

Expansion of welfare, the furthering of union rights and increased funding for neglected infrastructure projects were the main highlights of the new party platform. For the final day, many had assumed that the party would continue talking about policy, finally ending with the leader of the party giving a speech. However, this was not the case. Instead, it came as a surprise to many to see former President Sonia Sotomayor come to the stage and proudly nominate [AMC.GetLeader] as her successor. She channelled her inner revolutionary stating that ''as long as our party stands, the ideals of Bernie Sanders live on. The only way America can truly prosper is under a Socialist Party president.''

Hearing this news from his advisors was a great relief for Bernie Sanders, after being constantly bombarded by reports of outrage in the initial stages of this invasion. At least America seems to have cozied up to the idea of a necessary battle for reunification..."

 natbolamerica.8.t:0 "Provisional Congress Dissolved"
 natbolamerica.8.d:0 "In times of peace the Provisional Congress may have been an excellent initiative, allowing us to rapidly restore free and fair democracy within the American People's Commonwealth. However, with our nation remaining in a state of war with the South, a hard decision was made by President Sanders after a series of meetings with representatives from each state. Instead of maintaining a useless institution with little power in the first place, the commander in chief decided to formally dissolve America's Provisional Congress until it can be restored during peace time."

 natbolamerica.9.t:0 "Funeral of Bernie Sanders"
 natbolamerica.9.d:0 "The Supreme Leader's coffin travelled via an extremely secure motorcade from Philadelphia to his first home in Vermont today, where the final stage of an internationally televised state funeral was to take place. Along its journey, millions gathered to weep and pay their respects to the respected glorious North American leader, who for years has sacrificed everything to keep us safe from reactionary foreign invaders. Each day of his life the threat of occupation was always terrifyingly present, but Bernie Sanders pulled the entire nation through until it could gain the strength necessary to defend itself. His devotion to public service has made him the most popular American head of state in history, evident in the enormous crowds along each side of major freeways on which his motorcade travelled. In these dark times, it is now up to the National People's Council to elect a rightful successor to the Supreme Leader... and the people have certainly placed their faith in these few politicians to do the right thing."

 natbolamerica.10.t:0 "Chairman Denounces Sanders"
 natbolamerica.10.d:0 "The Chairman of the National People's Council has addressed the Union's greatest political body in a fiery speech today. Instead of reinforcing the ideals of Bernie Sanders, our supposedly loyal Chairman immediately condemned the Supreme Leader and his overall vision for the American people. From a 'cult of personality', to failed foreign initiatives started but never completed by the late head of state, there seemed to be a lot wrong with Sanders and nothing right according to this charismatic speaker. While the speech itself had already brought shocked expressions to every single face in the chamber, it was his last words that drew audible gasps. 'The dictator rots!'."
 natbolamerica.10.o1:0 "He's right!"
 natbolamerica.11.t:0 "Trade Council Leaders Arrested"
 natbolamerica.11.d:0 "The Chiefs of every single national Trade Council within the Commonwealth, as well as their successor 'proteges' have been arrested in a spectacular display of force from President Sanders. Late this afternoon they were rounded up by military police on orders from the executive branch, and subsequently taken to an remote maximum security prison in central Pennsylvania. Their exact whereabouts are unknown at the moment, but a spokesperson for the President shocking announced not long after the event that Chiefs had been 'ratted out' as traitors. Supposedly they had been leaking classified military information to our enemies in the South and ensuring that President Sanders would not be able to secure total victory."
 natbolamerica.11.o1:0 "They should be executed for treason!"
 natbolamerica.12.t:0 "The Greater American Union"
 natbolamerica.12.d:0 "In his first address to the nation since we claimed victory over Atlanta, President Bernie Sanders has proclaimed a new beginning for the American people. Instead of restoring Congress to its initial power before hostilities began, the commander in chief declared democracy must be postponed for the time being... at least until our nation can get on its feet again. But while his address initially began calmly and with reason, it gradually became ferocious and threatening against certain groups of people within the Commonwealth. Namely, Sanders called out allies of the former Central Committee, state Governors who he once sought the approval of, and even Noam Chomsky himself. They were labelled traitors to the new socialist cause, outcasts in the eyes of a revived American populace. The end of his speech however truly caught the entire planet's attention. Despite once advocating for a simply reformed American People's Commonwealth, the President announced in front of an enormous wall of the stars and stripes, that a Greater American Union shall be established in the same territories in which we now reside."
 natbolamerica.12.o1:0 "A greater what?"
 natbolamerica.13.t:0 "Trial of the Committee"
 natbolamerica.13.d:0 "Members of the old Commonwealth Central Committee have been sentenced to death during the most-watched trial in American history. Bernie Sanders' personally selected Free Tribunal was convened today by the head of state himself to consolidate power over the Union and finally remove those wretched 'revolutionary socialists' from existence. From the very beginning of America's second revolution, they sought to crush the lives of every single person who got in their way, notably countless families in Vermont at the time. Today they have finally received a taste of their own medicine, after being executed by firing squad just hours after the Tribunal decided that the most justified sentencing was not life... but death."
 natbolamerica.13.o1:0 "Their reign is over"
 natbolamerica.14.t:0 "Operation Lake Smoke"
 natbolamerica.14.d:0 "Operation Lake Smoke, a detailed plan for the total obliteration of forces from the Great Lakes Republic, was drafted in secrecy by Bernie Sanders himself years ago. As Governor of Vermont he believed it was in the best interests of all Americans to violently push for reunification, and the first nation that needed to be 'wiped out' was the Great Lakes. Today the plan was for the first time ever revealed to members of Sanders' elite national security council, who quickly agreed that Operation Lake Smoke should begin as soon as possible. All troops are ready to cross the border and administrators within our own states have been informed of the upcoming war."
 natbolamerica.14.o1:0 "Ok"
 natbolamerica.15.t:0 "Operation Mountain Ridge"
 natbolamerica.15.d:0 "Operation Mountain Ridge is a complex plan for the inevitable war with Montana's oppressive government, designed by senior members of the national security council. It was mainly designed around the unique terrain within Montana's borders, and hand-picked by Bernie Sanders as the right course of action in the event of war with their nation. Unlike some other war plans for American reunification, Mountain Ridge was not named by Sanders. In fact, all officials within the council had seen it before the Supreme Leader could feast his eyes on the details, marking a rare occurrence in the Union's military command structure."
 natbolamerica.15.o1:0 "Ok"
 natbolamerica.16.t:0 "Operation Shining Star"
 natbolamerica.16.d:0 "Operation Shining Star in its final form has just been presented to [Root.GetLeader] for final consideration, upon which it will hopefully be put into effect as quickly as possible. American forces are already amassing to invade the notoriously rebellious state of Texas, and when the time is right they will rapidly move in to totally wipe Texan troops out. This stage of the American revanchist plan has turned out to be far more complex than any others prepared by the national security council, as it delves deeper into the post-occupation process, in which we will have to fight against an unprecedented rebel force. Despite this, [Root.GetLeader] is trying to keep focused on the situation at hand, and at the moment it seems American armies will easily crush whatever opposition Texas throws at us."
 natbolamerica.16.o1:0 "Ok"
 natbolamerica.17.t:0 "Operation Forest Plain"
 natbolamerica.17.d:0 "Operation Forest Plain is the war plan for invasion of Illinois' weak Republic. Since the collapse of the United States, Illinois has maintained a precarious position between major post-Reagan states, with a weak economy and simple but failed political system. These factors combined make for a poor opposition to our onslaught of endless proud American soldiers in the inevitable war for supremacy over Illinois. With these soldiers ready at the border, Operation Forest Plain should go off without a hitch, and the national security council will have achieved another outstanding strategic victory with the glorious guidance of [Root.GetLeader]."
 natbolamerica.17.o1:0 "Ok"
 natbolamerica.18.t:0 "Operation Blue Sky"
 natbolamerica.18.d:0 "Operation Blue Sky will involve a rapid and simple occupation of the Midwestern states. Their decentral society with minimal defence forces poses virtually no threat to American armies, meaning we could simply stroll across their lands with hardly any bullets fired. This is at least the plan detailed in Operation Blue Sky, a quickly drafted operation from Philadelphia's military elite. This time the national security council left the task of drafting this plan to their proteges in lower positions, evidently showcasing the importance of extensive planning for such a weak opponent."
 natbolamerica.18.o1:0 "Ok"
 natbolamerica.19.t:0 "Operation Looming Desert"
 natbolamerica.19.d:0 "Operation Looming Desert shall see endless American troops rolling across Utah's magnificent geographically diverse landscapes towards the capital of Salt Lake City. Upon arrival the drafted plan indicates that enemy forces will immediately surrender and lay down their arms, an event that the national security council and other propaganda experts within our nation are eager to exploit for later use. However, we must now solely be focusing on the initial invasion plans for Eastern Utah, where we will begin rolling out fearsome and proud American soldiers. The looming desert may seem endless to some, but to our forces it will be a walk in the park."
 natbolamerica.19.o1:0 "Ok"
 natbolamerica.20.t:0 "Operation Yellow Sun"
 natbolamerica.20.d:0 "Named after the rays of yellow bursting out of the star on Arizona's flag, Operation Yellow Sun is the next stage in [Root.GetLeader]'s plan for rapid American reunification. The plan is focused around a swift occupation of border regions and subsequent invasion force destined for Phoenix. However, the specifics of the actual invasion plan are more than likely set to change once forces are lined up along the border with Arizona and [Root.GetLeader] declares commitment to war with the small but united nation."
 natbolamerica.20.o1:0 "Ok"
 natbolamerica.21.t:0 "Jeff Mackler Becomes Supreme Leader"
 natbolamerica.21.d:0 "Loyal protege of the late Bernie Sanders and ally since our victory over the repulsive American Republic, Jeff Mackler, has just been sworn in as Supreme Leader of this glorious Greater American Union. His faction's expected victory in the emergency party convention came as a shock to no one, and plans were already in motion to name him Sanders' official successor even before the chamber closed. This comes as a great relief to many members of the National People's Council, who were worried that National Syndicalist supremacy would bring an end to their beloved Supreme Leader's concrete vision, and an even more unexpected Communist victory in elections would see an end to the Union as we know it. Mackler has been hailed as the next great savior of our nation, leaving his office to address hundreds of thousands in the streets below, who were eager to hear the very first words from a relatively unknown but previously powerful politician. The age of Sanders will never be forgotten, but it is certainly over forever."
 natbolamerica.21.o1:0 "Glory to the Supreme Leader!"
 natbolamerica.22.t:0 "Leo Gerard Becomes Supreme Leader"
 natbolamerica.22.d:0 "Both friend and enemy of the late Bernie Sanders since our victory over the repulsive American Republic, Leo Gerard represented unionist interests in the APC before leading the national syndicalist faction in recent years. Today he was sworn in as Supreme Leader of this glorious Greater American Union. His faction's unexpected victory in the emergency party convention came as a shock to most, as plans were already in motion to name Sanders' protege Jeff Mackler his successor before the chamber closed. This comes as a worrying sign to many members of the National People's Council, who are concerned that National Syndicalists must now represent a majority of the political body, as this landslide victory couldn't have been achieved otherwise. On the other hand, they remain glad that the Communist faction was unable to seize power in this struggle for the leadership. Gerard has been hailed as the next great savior of our nation, leaving his office to address hundreds of thousands in the streets below. The age of Sanders will never be forgotten, but it is certainly over forever."
 natbolamerica.22.o1:0 "Glory to the Supreme Leader!"
 natbolamerica.23.t:0 "Sam Webb Becomes Supreme Leader"
 natbolamerica.23.d:0 "Notorious supporter of Communist 'confidence and supply' for Bernie Sanders since our victory over the repulsive American Republic, Sam Webb has just been sworn in as Supreme Leader of this glorious Greater American Union. His faction's completely unexpected victory in the emergency party convention came as a shock to the world, as plans were already in motion to name Sanders' protege Jeff Mackler his successor before the chamber closed. This comes as a worrying sign to loyal supporters of Bernie Sanders and his cause, as it is now clear that the Communist faction has grown to dominate the National People's Council. No longer do loyalists or National Syndicalists have the upper hand, now marginalised by this terrifying political player. Nevertheless, Webb has been hailed as the next great savior of our nation, leaving his office to address hundreds of thousands in the streets below, who were eager to hear the very first words from a radically different Supreme Leader. The age of Sanders will never be forgotten, but it is certainly over forever."

 natbolamerica.24.d:0 "'I, Lori Jean Robinson do solemnly swear, that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the American people, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the rights enshrined in their constitution. So help me God.'\n\nGeneral Lori Robinson's oath of office triggered a great roar from the millions watching in person and certainly drew the same reaction from people all around the world. Her campaign based around military discipline and 'common sense' was unprecedented in its ability to gather support from the most unlikely American regions, attracting both hardline conservatives in the deep South to liberals in the North-East. She has been seen as the common ground between both sides of the political spectrum, transcending ideology and simply working for the American people as a whole. This is how the American presidency should have been seen many years ago, but at least generations later citizens of this great country are experiencing what they couldn't thirty years ago."

So help me Lord Almighty.'\n\nPastor Fred Phelps' oath of office triggered a great roar from the millions watching in person and certainly drew the same reaction from people all around the world. His campaign based around religious revival and an American reconnection with God was unprecedented in its ability to fend off criticism and attacks from each side of the political spectrum. The unique candidate hardly saw any drops in opinion polls, only continuing to rise every single day. Phelps has been seen as the savior of American traditionalism, even transcending common ideologies in order to achieve 'what God would want'."

 natbolamerica.26.d:0 "'I, Laura Lane Welch do solemnly swear, that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the American people, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the rights enshrined in their constitution. So help me God.'\n\nLaura Welch's oath of office triggered a great roar from the millions watching in person and certainly drew the same reaction from people all around the world. Her campaign based around total restoration of free democracy, capitalism and a new American dream was unprecedented in its ability to unite both rural and urban voters. Welch transcended the historical divide between these two groups, creating a united front to restore American freedom as we once knew it. She has been seen as a candidate for the greatest American President since George Washington, in her magnificent fight against Bernie Sanders' dictatorship from his Southern conquest to this emergency election, unlike some other prominent politicians who collaborated."
 natbolamerica.26.o1:0 "We salute her, one and all!"
 natbolamerica.27.t:0 "Mike Pence Converts"
 natbolamerica.27.d:0 "Mysteriously titled the 'White Phoenix, Michael Pence has been a Catholic for his entire life, fighting against the Commonwealth government in a radical campaign that brought many deaths on both sides. Despite this lifelong devotion to one traditional form of Christianity, he announced yesterday that morning that he had formally converted to Evangelicalism. This extremely surprising announcement comes as several meetings have been set up between the freedom fighter and President Fred Phelps in recent weeks, where the details of such exchanges were kept private. It's likely however that this conversion comes from an agreement the two made in one of those meetings, as Phelps has outright refused to let a Catholic into his national government. The Southern 'White Phoenix' however isn't known for his prowess in domestic politics, so some have speculated that the former rebel may see himself as our future 'American Himmler'."
 natbolamerica.27.o1:0 "Interesting"
 natbolamerica.28.t:0 "House of Representatives Established"
 natbolamerica.28.d:0 "President Welch formally established the House of Representatives today, replacing the provisional body that has passed little legislation since its post-inauguration inception. It will act as the lower chamber of the new American National Congress, comprising half of the legislature. All representatives will be directly elected by the people, in stark contrast to many of the systems our citizens have been forced to live under for far too long. The President is expected to attend the lower house's first session and deliver a short speech before the day of politics and debates begins."
 natbolamerica.28.o1:0 "Ok"
 natbolamerica.29.t:0 "Senate Established"
 natbolamerica.29.d:0 "President Welch formally established the Grand American Senate today, replacing the provisional body that has passed little legislation alongside its 'House of Representatives' counterpart since post-inauguration inception. It will act as the upper chamber of the American National Congress, comprising half of the legislature. All representatives will be directly elected by the people, and will offer a barrier against the House's attempts at tyranny, a political 'feature' that many post-collapse American states lacked. The President is expected to attend the upper house's first session and deliver a short speech before subsequently naming a Vice President for the American people."
 natbolamerica.29.o1:0 "Ok"
 natbolamerica.31.t:0 "Southern Leaders Executed"
 natbolamerica.31.d:0 "In a spectacular show of might, Supreme Leader Sanders has orchestrated the simultaneous execution of prominent Southern leaders. President Donald Rumsfeld was the first to be lined up, but he was forced to endure the subsequent shackling and abuse of his fellow politicians mere metres away, as military police escorted many to the wall. Across the nation hundreds of similar events were occuring, a massive show of propaganda directed by Sanders' right hand man Jeff Mackler, in which each Southern leader would be shot at the same time. At midday, guns were fired and bullets pierced the brain of every traitor to the Greater American Union. At 1 PM many were still hanged along prominent avenues in each major city for every Southern citizen to see as an example of what treachery will do to a person."
 natbolamerica.31.o1:0 "Wonderful"
 natbolamerica.32.t:0 "Operation Emancipation"
 natbolamerica.32.d:0 "Operation Emancipation's unique name is the result of our national security council's mainstream views surrounding the Union of Lincoln. Richard Spencer and his gang seem to believe the Emancipation Proclamation was in fact Abraham Lincoln's way of 'freeing the white man from having to interact with the negro'. Hence Operation Emancipation is a less than discreet form of humiliation, as our loyal soldiers march into Lincoln in its name. Military commanders are ready to execute the invasion plan, and most believe it will go off without a hitch. Lincoln's isolation from the world has left it militarily vulnerable in every single aspect."
 natbolamerica.32.o1:0 "Ok"

 natbolamerica.33.d:0 "Finally Operation Coastal Menace will allow us to vanquish the Soviet threat from the American continent once and for all. While this may be the most difficult and extensively planned invasion, top military leaders from around the country have confirmed that it will indeed be successful. [Root.GetLeader] has reportedly expressed excitement upon announcing to fellow senior members of the government that this nation's final major war is imminent. Soon we shall have total peace and tranquility, and all those who oppose us will think twice before moving into our sacred lands."

 natbolamerica.34.t:0 "Operation Northern Lights"
 natbolamerica.34.d:0 "Operation Northern Lights seeks to obliterate Alaska within a month, but already some military leaders have expressed concerns about the feasability of such a small time frame. [Root.GetLeader] doesn't seem to care whether the invasion takes a month, two or more, as long as there are minimal losses and in the end Alaska is taken care of for good. Northern Lights will be one of the last wars for American reunification, so our soldiers are ensuring they will personally make it count."

 natbolamerica.37.d:0 "Despite the constitution of this great country dictating that a President can only be restricted to two terms, Laura Welch announced at the beginning of 2020's election campaign that she will not be seeking the nomination of her party. This came as a shock to so many Americans, who had grown to adore her and the feeling of unity she gave to all of us. Nevertheless, the commander in chief stated in a nationally televised press conference that the duties of public office were not what she intended to seek at any point in her life, only hoping to restore freedom to America before it was too late. Now she says it's time for her to be remembered as the woman who made it happen... and her successor should be remembered as the man or woman who 'moved us forward'. The transition President as she calls herself, will officially leave office once one candidate has claimed victory in today's election. Just like the emergency presidential vote three years ago, an abundance of nominees have been narrowed down to three dominating all political opinion polls. Albert Gore of the recently reinvigorated Democratic Party has been a Senator since Welch established the Grand American Senate years ago. Lindsey Graham on the other hand is Gore's infamous opponent, with both debating each other ferociously on national television for the past two years. Between these two heavyweights is John Kasich, the American Vice President and loyal friend of Laura Welch. While the two Senators battle it out, Kasich is seen as the favourite due to his likeability and loyalty to the beloved incumbent President."

It didn't take long for the coup forces to take total control over the American State, as loyal troops occupied government offices and even executed those who refused to comply with a list of demands. Some politicians have fled the country, as well as Catholic priests who famously supported Pence in his vision for an America in their name just a few weeks ago.

Instead of restoring Congress to its initial power before hostilities began, the commander in chief declared democracy must be postponed for the time being... at least until his nation can get on its feet again. But while his address initially began calmly and with reason, it gradually became ferocious and threatening against certain groups of people within the Commonwealth. Namely, Sanders called out allies of the former Central Committee, state Governors who he once sought the approval of, and even Noam Chomsky himself. They were labelled traitors to the new socialist cause, outcasts in the eyes of a revived American populace. The end of his speech however truly caught the entire planet's attention. Despite once advocating for a simply reformed American People's Commonwealth, the President announced in front of an enormous wall of the stars and stripes, that a Greater American Union shall be established in the same territories in which we now reside."

His faction's expected victory in the emergency party convention came as a shock to no one, and plans were already in motion to name him Sanders' official successor even before the chamber closed. This comes as a great relief to many members of the National People's Council, who were worried that National Syndicalist supremacy would bring an end to their beloved Supreme Leader's concrete vision, and an even more unexpected Communist victory in elections would see an end to the Union as we know it. Mackler has been hailed as the next 'great savior' of their nation, leaving his office to address hundreds of thousands in the streets below, who were eager to hear the very first words from a relatively unknown but previously powerful politician. The age of Sanders will never be forgotten, but it is certainly over forever."

This comes as a worrying sign to many members of the National People's Council, who are concerned that National Syndicalists must now represent a majority of the political body, as this landslide victory couldn't have been achieved otherwise. On the other hand, they remain glad that the Communist faction was unable to seize power in this struggle for the leadership. Gerard has been hailed as the next 'great savior', leaving his office to address hundreds of thousands in the streets below.

This comes as a worrying sign to loyal supporters of Bernie Sanders and his cause, as it is now clear that the Communist faction has grown to dominate the National People's Council. No longer do loyalists or national syndicalists have the upper hand, now marginalised by this terrifying political player. Nevertheless, Webb has been hailed as the next 'great savior', leaving his office to address hundreds of thousands in the streets below, who were eager to hear the very first words from a new Supreme Leader.

Camporini himself then proceeded to enter the building with an entourage of soldiers and secret police, proclaiming himself Chairman of the Communist Party.

With this democratic system in place, it will be up to him to decide what kind of reforms must be enacted, especially as support for a monarchist revival grows.

 uar.1.d:0 "Leader of the Syrian Arab Socialist Union branch, Bassel al-Assad has just been assassinated on the streets of Damascus. After a small party conference downtown, the regional administrator was seen conversing with locals at a nearby street market when two gunshots knocked him to the ground. A young assailant was quickly apprehended by Assad's bodyguards, but by then blood was already seeping out of two open wounds in his chest. As emergency services rushed him to hospital, news broke to the Cairo government, where President Sharaf reportedly expressed deep concern about the ripple effect this could have in a fragile Syria. Just two hours later Damascus City Hospital officially announced that Bassel al-Assad, patriarch of the prominent Syrian political family, had passed away and that his relatives had already been informed. The entire Republic including the central government remain in waiting, as the regional government must appoint a successor to their beloved leader. While Bassel was seen as cooperative and willing to work with any of Egypt's eminent factions, his likely successor and brother Bashar has in the past expressed significant discontent with the status quo. We can only hope that a more stable and qualified member of the Syrian Regional Assembly is given the top job."

 uar.2.d:0 "Although expected by most, it still came as a shock to President Sharaf's allies when the Syrian branch elected Bashar al-Assad to succeed his brother in the office of Regional President. At midday Damascus' political assembly convened in order to discuss succession, always a deeply dividing subject in these times of great strife. Moderate factions proposed various rising stars within the Arab Socialist union, who had all been friends of the recently assassinated Bassel. However, the strength of his family proved itself today, when Bashar al-Assad reportedly spoke with up to a hundred members in an effort to gain their explicit support. When the time came to hold a vote, Bashar won by an unprecedented majority, securing support from even the most loyal allies of Cairo. Two hours later he was sworn in as Regional President of Syria by Hassan al-Nouri."
 uar.2.o1:0 "Interesting"
 uar.3.t:0 "Rumours Spread"
 uar.3.d:0 "Rumours are spreading quickly through the streets of our nation and even in the halls of power, that Essam Sharaf himself orchestrated the assassination of Bassel al-Assad. The late President's assailant was gunned down by bodyguards, so any testimony from the man himself that could counter these rumours is lost forever. According to anonymous sources within the government, Sharaf is becoming increasingly worried that this could cause unrest both within Syria and Egypt, as the assassination of a Regional President by the head of state has never once occurred in our history... even when the two were bitter enemies. If any scrap of 'evidence' comes out supporting this view, or a prominent politician expresses concern that it could indeed be true, the United Arab Republic could very well come crashing down on itself. In these times we must tread very carefully..."
 uar.3.o1:0 "Absolutely ridiculous"
 uar.4.t:0 "Bashar al-Assad's View"
 uar.4.d:0 "Recently elected Regional President Bashar al-Assad believes Essam Sharaf assassinated his older brother. In a television interview with Canadian journalist Alex Jones from CTV, he stated that the rumours circulating around his nation must have some truth to them. In his belief members of Cairo's central government leaked reports to state journalists and around in other circles, in an attempt to bring down Sharaf and release the truth to our people. Jones pressed further as to whether al-Assad is considering radical options in response to Sharaf's supposed 'coup against Syria', but the President denied his administration is looking into those kinds of alternatives. Instead, Assad declared that he would work with interest groups to remove Essam Sharaf from office, in the hopes of restoring peace, stability and respect between the two Egyptian and Syrian nations."

 uar.5.t:0 "Violence Erupts in Syria"
 uar.5.d:0 "A bout of violence has erupted in the Syrian region today, with supporters of President Assad holding enormous rallies throughout the capital and other major cities. It didn't take long for these gatherings to result in clashes between opposition forces and local police, and sources at the scene reported to international media that bullets were used against the agitators. At the end of the day twenty people were killed on the streets, and Bashar al-Assad has already made an announcement to the regional assembly that something must change in the highest levels of government or else there will be an even stronger movement against President Essam Sharaf. But the longtime leader is clinging to his role of head of state, and apparently eager to disprove any rumours of his involvement in the assassination of Bassel al-Assad. These efforts seem to have been useless considering recent developments."
 uar.5.o1:0 "Put a stop to this"
 uar.6.t:0 "Attempt on Sharaf's Life"
 uar.6.d:0 "An attempt has been made on the life of President Essam Sharaf today. Meeting with members of both the Egyptian and Syrian governments, he was hoping to quell any rumours of his resignation and exit from politics altogether. The meetings lasted a few hours but attracted little media attention and even less results. However, just after leaving the home of Syria's Interior Minister, a small sedan parked mere metres away exploded sending fire and debris hurtling towards our head of state. If both of his bodyguards weren't at his side, then it is almost certain Sharaf would have been killed today. But nevertheless he is safe and simply recovering from minor injuries at Damascus City Hospital. Messages of solidarity almost immediately arrived from world leaders and in particular Middle Eastern heavyweights hoping to pick a side in the Arab 'crisis' as some international observers are calling it."
 uar.6.o1:0 "It's not a crisis yet"
 uar.7.t:0 "False Flag?"
 uar.7.d:0 "Bashar al-Assad has just made a televised announcement to the Syrian people, stating that he is certain the 'attempted assassination' of President Sharaf was a false flag. Apparently through this orchestrated attack, he intends to blame Assad and immediately establish direct rule over Syria and abolish any autonomy. Whether this is the case or not, Assad's populace are beginning to rally behind him and believe every single word he says, with even stronger calls for Essam Sharaf's removal from office either through resignation or a decree from the National Assembly. Assad said little more in this address, only making a further point that he still believes in the values of our United Arab Republic, and doesn't seek to bring it crashing down. That he says, is the aim of Sharaf and his allies in Cairo."
 uar.7.o1:0 "Utter buffoon"
 uar.8.t:0 "Assad Leaves Party"
 uar.8.d:0 "Supposedly furious that in the five days since his address to the Syrian people, not one politician in Cairo has called for Sharaf's resignation or made any moves to support the new Damascus government. His first course of action today was to immediately suspend his own membership in the Arab Socialist Union. Instead the only recently appointed Regional President now describes himself as an independent, free of the forces holding him down as a member of the country's largest political party. Rumours are spreading like wildfire, with some thinking he will restore the illegal Ba'ath Party his father originally created then left, while others believing he is genuine in his efforts to remain an independent politician. Whatever the outcome of this remarkable turn of events, it is becoming increasingly clear that the rift between President Sharaf and his counterpart in Damascus could end in disaster for our nation if not handled correctly."
 uar.8.o1:0 "Intriguing"
 uar.9.t:0 "Police Crackdown on Protests"
 uar.9.d:0 "Police in Aleppo have initiated an unprecedented crackdown on pro-Assad protests in the Northern city of Aleppo today, as the police chief authorised whatever force necessary to maintain law and order. The crackdown drew mixed responses from various politicians. Cairo heavyweights applauded the police chief's authorisation as a great sign of loyalty to the state he swore an oath to protect, despite calls from Syrian leaders for his immediate resignation alongside Essam Sharaf. This will surely be just another issue in the mounting pressures on political figures to find a solution as soon as possible, before horrific consequences become apparent."
 uar.9.o1:0 "Excellent"
 uar.10.t:0 "Bashar Joins Ba'ath Party"
 uar.10.d:0 "In a stunning speech to the Syrian Regional Assembly, President Bashar al-Assad issued a decree to legalise the Ba'ath party without approval from the central government. While this is technically within his constitutional right, not once has a regional leader ever violated national laws so blatantly and with disregard for the central government's wishes. After permitting his father's old party into politics once again, Assad subsequently proclaimed the end of his brief time as an independent politician, instead opting to both join and lead the new Syrian Ba'ath Party. Following this shocking announcement, half of the assembly simply walked out the door in a protest, while the other half gave Assad a standing ovation. Officially this new Ba'ath Party remains in a coalition with the Arab Socialist Union as a sign their leader supposedly still wants to remain a part of the United Arab Republic's political process. But many are beginning to suspect he has far more 'sinister' motives."

 uar.11.t:0 "Mubarak Arrests Assad"
 uar.11.d:0 "General Hosni Mubarak has just placed President Assad under house arrest, encircling his home with loyal troops and demanding he remain until the crisis in Damascus can be resolved. International journalists are already reporting on a 'coup', but besides this arrest there has been no evidence to suggest that Mubarak or his allies are making any more moves to take control from the Regional Assembly or Assad's new Ba'ath Party. Protests in the capital and even around the country escalated a few hours ago when news of the arrest was released, as the list of supposed 'traitors to Syria' increases. While Hosni Mubarak is relatively well known in Egypt, he is certainly seen as an outsider in the Syrian region, and any attempts to overthrow the Damascus government by a loyal Cairo military man are very likely to be crushed by popular revolt."
 uar.11.o1:0 "Don't try anything stupid"
 uar.12.t:0 "Bashar Escapes House Arrest"
 uar.12.d:0 "Seemingly through an insider within General Mubarak's guard, Bashar al-Assad has escaped house arrest in Damascus and vanished off the face of the Earth. The eminent Egyptian is reportedly furious and searching through those defending the Regional President's home for any traitors, but so far has come up with no suspects. Some cabinet members told President Sharaf that it is very likely he will seek out support from his allies within the Regional Assembly and exile himself to their homes in the meantime. This possibility has been laughed off by the head of state, ordering military forces in the large city to search every street and alleyway to find the rebellious Syrian."
 uar.12.o1:0 "He played us"
 uar.13.t:0 "Bashar Declares Syrian Independence"
 uar.13.d:0 "Less than a week after escaping house arrests and the wrath of Sharaf's military forces, Bashar al-Assad arrived at the Regional Assembly Building under the cover of darkness to deliver an address to the emergency session he called just a day earlier. Through back channels the leader orchestrated an unprecedented secret operation to alert allies to his presence and bring them all to the session in the dead of night, when military police wouldn't expect such a gathering. In this address he made sure to keep any opening statements short, almost immediately declaring the Syrian Arab Republic an independent state, free from the 'grip of Cairo'. All members shot up in their seats and began singing the recently rehearsed Ba'ath anthem, subsequently swearing an oath to their new state and their new national President. Essam Sharaf was woken in his sleep by advisors who quickly informed him of the developments in Damascus, causing him to reportedly throw a lamp at the wall."

 uar.14.t:0 "Mubarak Killed by Bodyguard"
 uar.14.d:0 "Just a day after Bashar al-Assad escaped house arrest, General Hosni Mubarak was killed by one of his most loyal bodyguards. The young Syrian man who has pledged allegiance to Mubarak for the past five years and participated in the arrest of Assad, unexpectedly turned on the Egyptian military heavyweight. A military police report indicates Mubarak died by one gunshot to the head in his sleep, as his own soldiers search Damascus for the whereabouts of Assad. Upon hearing this news, Essam Sharaf publicly announced that his faithful General would receive a state funeral as soon as possible, calling relatives to inform them of the tragic news. The motives of this lone assassin remain a mystery, but many suspect it is due to shifting allegiances, from the central government to Bashar al-Assad's new Syrian administration."

Should he wage a war against the traitors in Damascus to reunite the nation once and for all, or could these be the last days of Arab unity... perhaps Syria should be granted independence. For the sake of peace, many are demanding their President accept Assad's proclamation, while an equal amount both within cabinet and the National Assembly want Sharaf to immediately send troops into the region."

Islamic Socialists represent a large clique aiming to undermine the current Nasserist order, while Syndicalists continue to push for pro-union reforms in meetings with the head of state himself. While these two factions currently have far less power than the hardline Nasserists, it isn't necessarily unlikely that they would manage to convince other less devoted politicians to switch sides in the upcoming session."

It is both up to the President and his closest military advisors to find a replacement for him as soon as possible, putting the Arab army back on its tracks. A shortlist has been developed by these advisors, who claim to be neutral in their decision-making process but are known to have ties with certain Generals on the list. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is a prominent member of the military clique within Cairo. Mahmoud Hegazy was once considered as an option for Defence Minister but Tantawi himself was chosen instead years before demotion to Chief. Finally, Sedki Sobhy is viewed as a more stable and reliable option, being closely aligned to Sharaf's faction at every turn."

These allegations created a ripple effect bringing many close allies of the Chief into a harsh spotlight, revealing significant evidence of corruption. The military heavyweight's decision to resign today has shocked some and pleased many, as him remaining in the position any longer could have caused a greater political crisis that our politicians would be forced to resolve. Another selection process not long after the retirement of Tantawi is in place, but it has become clear that an opponent of Sisi, Mahmoud Hegazy, is set to become the next Arab Army's Chief."

Luckily, nearby units managed to get to the scene with enough time to save Hegazy and crush the ambush. Our Chief is reportedly on his way to Damascus City Hospital on a government jet, but has already informed President Essam Sharaf that he will be resigning from his post effective immediately.

However, many in Syria and even Egypt are hopeful that the formerly rebel nation can recover from destruction during the civil war. Cities across Syria were almost wiped out by military forces and terrorists that had seized the opportunity to stake their claim in the world. In particular, an image of a young woman walking with her child through the rubble of Aleppo sent shockwaves throughout the entire United Arab Republic, generating a movement for supporting Syria's people no matter the monetary cost. Whether it struck a chord with the President himself is up to debate, but pressures from within cabinet, the National Assembly and his own people without a doubt influenced his most recent decision."

 uar.43.d:0 "Construction workers have broken ground on a new international airport in Damascus today, as the national Infrastructure Minister proclaimed a new era of civil aviation both in Syria and the Republic as a whole. Damascus' old airport was itself in the process of being demolished before Bashar al-Assad declared independence, and was subsequently almost completely destroyed during an Air Force bombing campaign against the capital. This major achievement in the rebuilding process was met with joy from Syria's citizens, evident when international journalists interviewed those going about their business on the damaged streets. One older man said he was caught off guard when the national government announced it would be rebuilding Syria from the ground up, expecting them to 'neglect us into oblivion'."

The initiative kickstarted by a small group within [UAR.GetLeader]'s cabinet is supposedly the next step in their 'Rebuild Syria' plan, and has been recently actively promoted by the President himself. As military defences were set up on the border with Hatay state less than two days ago, national ministers from Cairo told journalists waiting at the site that this would be the first line of defence against an attack. While questioned as to the effectiveness of these defences, the Minister stated that while artillery and tanks could easily bring it down, it would still give our armies time to mobilise in case of a surprise attack. International critics of the border defence initiative include prominent Turkish politicians as well as [KUR.GetLeader], whose nation was included on the list of enemies to protect against. Despite the possible international condemnation it could bring from our neighbours, the national government agrees that defences are desperately needed along the Turkey-Kurdistan border."

Originally loyal to the central government, the Bank switched allegiances after Bashar al-Assad's sudden declaration of independence. Administrators within even dared to announce that 'the age of Cairo's domination is over' as they pumped unimaginable wealth into the short-lived Assad regime. Through this dissolution, any remaining assets that Central Bank hardliners and former Ba'ath loyalists keep from the Republic's administrative authorities in Syria, will be swiftly seized and transferred. Outrage from Syria's people has been minimal, as the decree coincides with further initiatives to develop Syria into another economic powerhouse within the United Arab Republic."

Whether these claims have accurate predictions behind them remains unknown, but rapid construction is set to begin as soon as possible, and international observers are eager to see what is in store. If the 'Nile River Economic Development Initiative', NREDI for short, succeeds as the President states, then the Republic could become one of the strongest economies in Africa to surpass other powerhouses to our South and West."

While this would certainly be a boost to the strength and capabilities of our entire military, it is also set to create an unprecedented amount of job opportunities that Egypt is so desperately in need of. Critics even within cabinet seem to think the New Egypt Proposal neglects any possibility of a civilian economy with goods allocated to the people, but this is simply untrue. Despite their claims, as well as negative coverage from international journalists, Egypt will not be a derelict wasteland or military dictatorship with only one economic goal. Instead, [UAR.GetLeader] merely aims to create a healthier balance between civilian and military industry... a balance that has been lost on previous leaders who focused too little on giving our armies the countless weapons they deserve."

However, a small faction within the National Assembly met with President [UAR.GetLeader] today to discuss the idea of investing even more in the industry. While initially sceptical of their plan, our head of state gradually shifted his stance on the issue, by the end of the meeting agreeing with their point that while funding had been directed, it had been directed into the wrong places and wrong proposals. Today [UAR.GetLeader] spoke with both prominent politicians and rising stars of Arab electronics to seek a final budget for this year, taking little time to finalise a drastically increased support fund. Introduced to and unanimously passed through the National Assembly mere hours later, it is clear the United Arab Republic is entering a new age of innovation and belief in its younger... more technologicall inclined generations."

The current military commander of Syria's multiple dysfunctional provinces reported back to Cairo that by the end of the day, all supporters of false President Bashar al-Assad will have been rounded up and shall soon face trial. These reports were met with congratulations from none other than [UAR.GetLeader] himself and his loyal allies within the National Assembly, who declared in a joint press conference that no one opposed to Cairo would be safe. Supposed 'democratic observers' from around the planet are angered at our show of force against traitors, but the excellent response from the President's Chief of Staff shot back.

Cheers from the stands were projected across the United Arab Republic through our citizens' television sets, and surely the millions watching at home also rejoiced at the Committee's verdict. Despite this mood of great joy, it was certainly gloomy for the traitorous 'President' Assad, who led a murderous regime bent on destroying Arab unity once and for all. At midday, the former rising star in Syrian politics was executed by hanging for all of Damascus to see, as his body remained limp in the city square for days after. Pictures of the dead leader circulated around the world until billions had seen the image, resulting in public outcry from the Republic's greatest enemies. According to the same organisations that condemned our rightful crackdown on Assad supporters and allies, the hanging of Bashar is an inhumane and internationally illegal act according to charters established by the United Nations many years ago. But as far as we are aware, that UN is long gone, replaced by one far more lenient to nations that exercise the death penalty against enemies of the state."

The President was making his way towards 'The Beast', when a hooded assassin approached and fired two gunshots into our beloved head of state, only to find himself tackled to the ground by the secret service. As onlookers and supporters of Bentley watched in horror, his wife Dianne quickly rushed him into the limousine with the help of bodyguards, where he was subsequently taken to the closest hospital. Doctors are now working around the clock to save our President, but initial reports from insiders suggest that there could be very dark times ahead. In Atlanta, Omarosa Manigault made a speech to Congress in which she told all Americans to pray for Robert Bentley's speedy recovery. If the rules of succession are followed, Manigault will become President of the American Republic upon her predecessor's untimely death.

With the President's certainly untimely death sending shockwaves through the Republic, there are already talks within Cabinet and Congress as to who should succeed him.

Long-time political fighter and popular opponent of both Presidents Bush and Rumsfeld, Joe Biden, is expected to win. However, from each faction within the Democrats there are serious contenders.

However, this time he chose to not specifically target the West or powers like Great Britain and Canada. Instead, the President spoke directly against the Soviet world order, one that he accuses of acting in an imperialistic manner, influencing neighbouring nations and orchestrating rebellions across the world in the name of total Communist domination. Following this speech to the National Assembly, a round of applause and standing ovation from sitting members below was televised across the country and to many around the world. While this isn't necessarily a new foreign policy direction for the President, it is the first time he has explicitly rejected the Soviet order as a 'force for good' as a significant number of socialists believe it is."

 uar.64.d:0 "Until now the Arab Socialist Union's secular policies have been put to the side, as it was believed by previous governments and even Sharaf himself at some point, that provoking fundamentalists within the Republic would break a fragile balance. However, with the destruction of Bashar al-Assad and a stronger nation established as a result, the National Assembly has officially condemned Islamic fundamentalism as an ideology. Reverting to the age-old secular ideals still enshrined in our constitution, representative after representative continued to proclaim that the age of reluctance and leniency was finally over, and all those who seek to bring down socialism within the Republic will be crushed. Some clerics are reportedly worried that this could mean the end of their 'careers', supposedly considering leaving the country for more welcoming neighbours. Nevertheless, we won't miss them."

 uar.65.d:0 "Fleeing from Iraq years ago after Saddam's crackdown on certain preachers, Ibrahim al-Badri settled in the decreasingly secular United Arab Republic. For a period of time after his arrival he lived a simple life, but gradually in the past two years has constructed a following of Islamic fundamentalists who believe Socialism in the Arab world must end as soon as possible. His teachings, preached in Cairo and spread throughout the country, are breeding hate and terror... and could easily result in catastrophic consequences. In line with their recent acknowledgement of secularism as a driving force behind Nasserism, the National Assembly ordered his arrest last night. Approved and signed by both Essam Sharaf and relevant cabinet members, the operation was entirely successful, as al-Badri accepted his fate almost instantly. He now remains in a maximum security prison, pending trial by a court directly controlled by our political allies. Soon he will be out of the picture and religious fundamentalism will see its end approaching quicker and quicker by the day."

 uar.66.d:0 "Independent trade unions have been banned by Cairo for countless years now, being seen as unnecessary within a Nasserist society. In their place, state-owned trade unions have acted as mediators and representatives of the workers. Syndicalists within the National Assembly and other political offices have repeatedly called for repealing this law, but pressure from colleagues within the parliament always lead them to dropping all demands. Now with the Syndicalist faction in control over the legislative branch, National Assembly delegates met with President Sharaf today to finally discuss the abolition of state-controlled trade unions and the restoration of all independent alternatives. Initially the head of state was reluctant to accept any demands of such significant proportions, but eventually gave in upon the pressuring of his Ministry of the Interior, signing a document just two hours ago to accept all proposals. Soon a new law will come into effect, and independent trade unions will once again be permitted to operate and even enter politics."

 uar.67.d:0 "Since the time of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the National Assembly has remained our Republic's sole legislative body, a unicameral parliament. Despite this precedent however, abolishing the National Assembly has remained a significant idea within the Syndicalist agenda, as its proponents instead believe a 'Syndicates Assembly' should replace it. Today their dream has been realised, with the National Assembly officially abolished by unanimous decree and some members even stripped of their titles. In its place, the Arab Trade Syndicates Assembly has been brought in with immediate effect, now acting as the parliament's successor. According to a government spokesperson who discussed the recent developments with international media, the Trade Syndicates Assembly will bring together representatives from each independent union across the nation, and remove all power from President Essam Sharaf. While the decrees never explicitly stated removal of the head of state was necessary, it didn't take long for Sharaf to tender his resignation. According to the long-time leader, in the face of such backlash against his ideals and the 'Nasserist' way, he decided it was simply best for the nation not to be forced into an eternal conflict between parliament and leader."

Upon their placement within the chamber and preparations for a televised address to the nation were finalised, the Assembly Speaker took to the podium. After a long speech concerning the future of our nation, Syndicalism as a whole, and the idea of Arab unity, the final blow to former President Sharaf and all his predecessors came. With full consent of every sitting member, the Trade Syndicates Assembly would now officially denounce Nasserism as a failed ideology, rejecting it as the ideal path towards Arab unification. While it may have shocked many outside our country, millions had already come to suspect that the age of Gamal Nasser had truly come to an end with Essam Sharaf's voluntary resignation from the highest office in the land. It was only a matter of time until all of its last remnants were swept away by the force of reform and significant change."

Their constant calls for revolt and endorsements of several violent riots across the nation have led to unnecessary deaths and certainly destabilised our once safe Republic. In response to these traitors, Hegazy has ordered an immediate crackdown on all opposition within Egypt and Syria, calling for an end to instability. While this move has garnered international condemnation, especially from world powers, citizens within the Republic are obviously more than happy to see their new President using his unlimited powers to restore some order to this shattered country. By the end of the week, hopefully all rebellious elements will have been destroyed and Mahmoud Hegazy can get back on track restoring the Republic to its former glory."

The announcement has been met with outrage from some and relief from others, as many still hold the belief that a new democratic government would bring chaos to our nation. Those outraged have attempted to express their opinion against the military government in the streets, but soldiers quickly put down this insurrection, arresting all those that could be caught in a joint operation with local police. The President himself stated in his address that the cancelling of elections will give both Cairo and Damascus breathing room to develop the country and hopefully return to a strong and stable civilian government. But until then, all democratic elements of the previous administration have finally been swept away, ushering in a new era of military dominance."

Today his demands were met and the unicameral parliament convened to debate a set of bills that would permit our citizens to say almost whatever they wished against the government without fear of persecution. Reports from the capital in the last five minutes indicate that the vote has been finalised, and all bills have been passed with little opposition. As the people celebrate for the first time either at home or in the streets, the President still denies that this will lead to total democracy. To this proposal he states that Western democratic institutions failed long ago, and what he intends to establish in Egypt and Syria is akin to a dictatorship that works directly for the people, and gives them a say in any way besides election campaigns. For now our citizens are content with this, having lived under repressive regimes for too many years."

Usually each military branch remains relatively apolitical in matters not concerning the security of the nation as a whole, but in these rare circumstances it was deemed necessary by many. [UAR.GetLeader] stated alongside prominent Generals within both the Army and Air Force, that this pledge will ensure that Islamic Socialism remains a dominant and 'all-consuming' ideology that will reach every corner of the Republic. However, reactions from within the government itself have been mixed. On the one hand ministers are excited for a new era in the military, believing that this will strengthen morale. On the other, there are those that see this as a dangerous path for the Republic, that can only lead to more tyranny and unchecked Presidential powers."

Unlike a simple dissolution that has occured in the past under Essam Sharaf and his predecessors, this abolition means the unconditional end for parliamentary governance. In its place, Hegazy will rule as a one-man dictator, advised only by his cabinet and other outside influences. Members of the Assembly are reportedly furious at the head of state, who they believed could offer a peaceful solution between moderates and the current military regime. Their anger however has been met with no remorse from Hegazy, who claimed in an interview with international media last night, that the parliament had brought us a terrible civil war, and was bringing us ever closer to a second if it was allowed to operate any longer. Whether this is true or not remains questionable, but for now it is clear our commander does not wish to participate in any more partisan politics."

It certainly didn't take long for the President to issue an order to all units that any citizen engaging in such reckless and harmful behaviour, must be arrested immediately through whatever means necessary. That order was released two days ago, and already reports are coming in from across the Republic that disturbances have dropped exponentially.

Just a few hours ago the National Assembly convened to discuss a plan involving our head of state's peaceful removal in favour of a younger and stronger candidate, but these debates were put on hold due to a sudden declared state of emergency. The President himself had ordered that all political activities must be suspended indefinitely, and martial law would be implemented to 'secure the stability of the United Arab Republic'. According to sources both within the military and other levels of government, these two events set in motion a chain of events at the highest intelligence agency echelons that would bring down Sharaf in a matter of hours. Now, with chaos in the streets gradually coming to an end, and the nation finally realising what had just happened, the world is eager to hear what our new government's first steps will be... and where on Earth the former President is.

By 4:00 am, counter-terrorist operatives had entered the lobby, and most of the remaining Naxalites had surrendered to government forces by 6:00am. However the disjointed response and lack of communication between government offices led to mismanagement of the situation and it's estimated around twenty police officers have been killed in the crossfire due to being ill suited for the task.

Most prominently is the Left Front coalition of leftist parties, featuring the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India. At the helm of the coalition is the hardliner Sitaram Yechury, known for his close ties to the Soviet sphere and his fiery rhetoric; the coalition hopes such enthusiasm can finally break the INC. In addition to the two giants of the INC and Left Front, there is a dark horse in the race, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. Widely seen as the political arm of the paramilitary Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sandh, the current leadership under Arun Jaitley is hoping that by deemphasizing the party's historic Hindu Nationalism and focusing on his proposed economic reforms, he can lead the party to power on the coattails of the middle class and those opposed to both the continuation of the INC's heavy regulation and the alternative proposed by the Left Front, although his lack of ties with the RSS and his more moderate agenda threaten to endanger the vital ties between the BJS and the popular RSS which could split his vote base."

Even more shockingly it appears that many members of India's communist movement were tipped off by inside sources, a fact that is leading to the administration having increased worries about the continued loyalty of the bureaucracy. Furthermore, there are already reports that some of the more hardline members, including former party leader Sitaram Yechury, have joined up with Naxalite cells in a continued effort to undermine our administration."

Despite the government insisting that no such actions are being taken, and that, if such action was to be taken, it would be purely for the prevention of disruption to Indian society, opposition campaigners are calling out the administration for the apparent reckless abuse of power."

Finally the strain has become too much and supporters of the ousted chairman have joined with far more radical underground elements of the Naxalite movement to restore what they see as the 'legitimate government'."

With security forces breaching his safehouse just inside the border with Pakistan, our brave forces managed to catch the Kashmiri Mujahideen leader sleeping. With such a key military leader of the insurgency under custody, the damage to the operational effectiveness of the group should be greatly impaired."

Firefights lasted into the night as troops loyal to the Delhi government slowly wore down and pushed into the insurgent stronghold in the Kashmir Valley. Following the raid, two leading figures in the rebel outfit were confirmed dead and vast amounts of equipment have been interned by the central government. Hopefully, this will set back the JKLF immensely and allow for the central government to properly establish control in the meantime."

 india.109.d:0 "In order to restore order to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, the current administration has seen it fit to impose limited bans on media in the state to prevent the inflammation of opinion.

 india.113.d:0 "Despite anger from sections of our society over the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, no one expected such radical action. With the blast blowing a deep hole into the eastern wall of the west wing, the peaceful Srinagar afternoon was torn asunder by the terrorist attack. Whilst the authorities are still investigating the case, they are still unsure as to if the attack was perpetrated by Kashmiri insurgents opposed to the Delhi government or by those wanting harsher measures.

With anonymous journalists reporting that troops loyal to the Delhi government have been using the declaration of martial law in the state as cover for numerous human rights abuses and the use of excessive violence against Kashmiri citizens.

Recording in detail cases of abuse ranging from torture to low level corruption the publication is a damning indictment of [Root.GetLeader]'s administration. With the failure of the government to take action on the matter the administration has been shown to be useless at best and actively engaged in oppression of the state's citizens at worse."

 india.118.d:0 "Following government investigation into the possibility of human rights abuse in the state of Jammu and Kashmir after concerns were raised by activists and anonymous sources it appears that there has been a level of abuse occuring among military personnel. Fortunately the administration has managed to clamp down on this issue before it could get worse and damage our work in Jammu and Kashmir and a few court martials have already begun to bring the small miscreants to justice."

With the options on the ballot originally only between remaining as a state of India or independence, the federal government conspicuously leaving out an option for the state to join Pakistan, the pressure both within the country and from Islamabad eventually led [Root.GetLeader] to add the third option. Thus in the coming days the people of Jammu and Kashmir will decide their fate; whether to remain a part of the Indian republic, be annexed by the government in Islamabad, or finally liberate the Kashmiri peoples under their own banner."

 india.125.d:0 "Despite the option being added only at the last minute following pressure from observers, and was hardly added in good grace, it appears that the people of Kashmir have voted in favour of the state's ascension to the Pakistani state. Despite our promises to respect the plebiscite's results the idea of handing over Kashmir to the government in Islamabad after so many Indians sacrificed their lives to keep it out of Pakistan's hands is disconcerting and there are widespread calls to void to plebiscite."

Despite the apparent attempts to ensure a fair vote, there were isolated cases of less than democratic actions surrounding the vote. Some members of the government believe that as such, the vote is a false and meaningless farce on the part of the Indian government and that we should denounce it."

Following a brief ceremony punctuated by speeches from Pakistani officials and a short and barebones speech by the relatively unknown representative for India in lieu of the prime minister, the flag of India was lowered from the State Legislative Assembly before the subsequent raising of the Pakistani flag amidst much fanfare.

As such it is now necessary for a resolution for the situation at least in the short term; whether this involves maintaining Jammu and Kashmir as a state until further action can be resolved or by establishing a Kashmiri nation to govern the region in lieu of proposed power transfers."

With the threat of yet another Indo-Pakistan War certain officials are suggesting we back down in face of Islamabad and the questionable measures taken in voiding the results, even if such action would be a massive blow to the pride and integrity of the Indian nation."

Aditya, a key official in the allocation of government contracts and construction planning, as he attempted to board a plane destined for Iran. As the bureaucrat was dragged into the back of a waiting police van journalists flocked to the scene turning the airport entrance into a lightshow. For now we can only congratulate the dedication and service of our officers."

 india.177.d:0 "With the recent arrest of M.R. Aditya shocking allegations have come to the attention of the government. The planning official has confessed to receiving kickbacks from the Soviet state-industry Mostotrest in exchange for priority from the commission in the awarding of government construction contracts alongside alleged collusion by cabinet members in the scheme. With the commission overlooking other bidders in favour for less optimal Mostotrest offers in exchange for bribes, the officials have undermined the quality of India's infrastructure and it is suggested that their actions are in part to blame for the poor quality of recent irrigation systems. Whilst the outcry against this blatant corruption in our bureaucracy is likely to be massive we could perhaps try to shift the blame to Mostotrest in order to divert the blame and allow us to deal with the situation properly without having to deal with crippling public pressure, although it may be a better choice to downplay the soviet role in order to maintain good relations and continued economic relations."

Alleging that Mostotrest has been engaged in illegal activities, bribing key government officials in exchange for priority in the awarding of government construction programmes, the Indian government has recklessly attacked our companies supposed role and denounce the U.S.S.R. for it. Whilst we could retort to these claims as baseless and protect the good name of Mostotrest it may be more prudent to stay silent whilst India works to resolve its issues at home."

With major members of the cabinet being found guilty of charges relating to the case confessions have been provided alleging the involvement of the highest offices of state in the fraud, some even suggesting the involvement of then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. Obviously the evidence is not concrete, but the existence of these claims is extremely worrying for the Indian National Government and their long time leader Rajiv Gandhi who has led the party since the death of Indira Gandhi in 1998. Whilst the administration could decide the evidence is not enough to warrant his investigation, there are now calls for Gandhi to be placed before the judiciary and justice be dealt ... if necessary."

Given the current climate such figures have come forward with damning evidence against Rajiv Gandhi. An anonymous source has provided government official's with a dossier alleging Gandhi has been receiving funds from the major security force of the Soviet Union, the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti or KGB. Whilst the dossier does not go into detail as to the reasoning for the funds it does provide extensive files documenting the transactions and has some barethread allegations claiming the funding to be to secure Moscow's interests in the subcontinent.

As the country is sent reeling by the discoveries made the INC lays shattered by the loss of their long time leader, both as a trusted political figure and as a politician physically able to lead the part. With this a clear message is sent to the country; no matter their position of power, no matter their years of service, no matter how clean they appear, all are accountable before the law and corruption is not acceptable in India whether you be prime minister or common citizen."

The previously undisputed heir to the INC leadership Rahul Gandhi, whilst still a highly popular choice, is plagued in the debate by his father's legacy and what was once his greatest strength in his journey to the premiership is now his greatest weakness, dragging him down with the Nehru-Gandhi name tarnished by corruption. The other main figure looking to use the fall of Rajiv Gandhi to ascend to power is Pranab Mukherjee, long time opponent of Rajiv Gandhi and long time Indira Gandhi loyalist with their feud over the leadership stretching across the party since Rajiv Gandhi was positioned as the successor to Indira Gandhi. Mukherjee promises to eradicate the dynastic politics of the party and restore the INC. Lastly there is Sharad Pawar, attacking the Mukherjee-Gandhi feud as divisive and unhealthy for the party.

Refusing RSS demands to reduce restrictions on the organisation, both through RSS-aligned politicians in the BJS and by the organisation itself, [From.GetLeader] has instead implemented stronger regulations on the group and expelled party members aligned with the RSS.

Despite the inauguration of the Empire of India, the government is still operating with republican procedures, while the supposedly monarchical state is held together not by legislation or formal systems, but by the charisma of our beloved Rajiv Gandhi and continuing emergency powers. In order to ensure the future security and long term stability of the Empire, it is essential that we work towards the formalisation of the new reality and the transformation of our republican institutions into something more appropriate for the imperial realities. Whilst we could seek the support of the parliament, in order to push through a new structure and have some continuity with the republic and ensure a smooth and popular transition; this could be seen as an affront to what our new empire is to stand for, and some say it would be wiser to extend the emergency powers granted to Rajiv Gandhi and transform them into supreme executive power, for a prosperous future of rule from the House of Nehru-Gandhi."

Concerns are being raised over the status of security for the building and the political climate in the empire that would allow such an attack to be enacted. Whilst mourning has commenced for those brave officers who laid down their life defending the nation from these foul Marxists, while the remains of those who would assault the heart of the empire have been 'disposed of', it is hoped that lessons have been learnt and such tragedy will never be allowed to occur again."

Whilst a smattering of government officials defamed the integrity and achievements of the emperor, including some members of parliament who had the audacity to embarrass themselves in front of the nation by dissenting during the meeting of the Lok Sabha, such misguided and subversive elements have been properly dealt with and the security of the imperial administration is assured."

With this, the realities of the imperial regime have been truly realised, and the threat posed by corrupt parliamentarians possibly subverting the popular rule of His Imperial Majesty has been decisively ended.

Fully intended to provoke Gandhi to veto the bill, the bill was swiftly voted down by the body before the emperor even had a chance to veto the bill.

Replacing the current system will the Lok Sabha now be composed of officials appointed directly by the emperor, in an attempt to select figures that can properly represent the concerns of the citizenry, without damaging politicking at their expense.

Whilst the majority of the party fell behind our great leader in his rise to the imperial throne, the continued position of power for the party is seemingly at odds with the concept of a benevolent monarchy, working beyond such outdated politics and in the interest of the citizenry. However dissolving the party in its entirety is impossible, given how much of our support is based in the legacy of the family within the party and the Congress Party's control over the key apparatus of state. In moving forward, a decision must be taken as to whether to preserve the legacy of the party in the subcontinent, which would help maintain stability or try to prevent any further accumulation or power within our inter-party rivals hands."

That they would criticise the administration for running the nation with integrity and dedication is concerning and has the administration worried. On one hand it implies that such corruption extends much further, and that we may need to dig further and teach these corrupt subversives a lesson. On the other, the dissent shown by inside figures of the administration within the court and Congress party undermines His Imperial Majesty's authority over the nation, and some have suggested that we should lax up on the cases to prevent any further issues arising from our own."

Claiming that the original owner of the diamond is unknown and with no verifiable way of determining the legitimacy of our claims, they will maintain ownership of the artefact. This blatant insult against the right of the Indian people to their own history greatly upsets the imperial administration and undermines the position of the emperor, in failing to achieve the fulfilment of our demands."

[From.GetLeader] has begun proceedings to allow for the transportation of the historic item from its current housing in the Tower of London to the capable hands of the Indian government. With this, we reclaim a part of history and culture; investing the Indian people with a further sense of dedication and service to the imperial administration, that has shown its capability in protecting the people's interests."

Coming in the dead of night, the decree has little practical effect given the powerlessness of the body, and there has been little response to the Emperor's action. With there no promise of new elections or replacement, this decree is the formal end of Indian democracy, showcasing the absolute power of our emperor as the new reality; he and his descendants shall lead India to new heights of prosperity and unity under the royal House of Nehru-Gandhi.

Obviously, the five year term that the CPI(M) led Left-Front coalition is coming to an end, unfortunately our success is far from certain despite our service to the people. Yet again the forces of reaction and the global bourgeoisie have worked to undemocratically subvert our administration and have sabotaged our work. With certain coalition partners less than loyal to the cause, having the arrogance to call us tyrannical, and with the opposition working to undermine us, the current membership of the Politburo does not believe that we can maintain power through India's bourgeois democracy and is in agreement as to the needed measures the people's government must take. With the need to restore order to the situation as reactionaries attempt to seize power during the election run-up through underhanded means, the proletariat must organise itself, with the loyal and dedicated 'aid' of the armed forces, to ensure the everlasting rule of the people in India."

Seeking to strengthen the grip of the CPI(M) and prevent the degradation of the achievements of the working class, loyal security forces have left their barracks in New Delhi and across the country under orders to seize key installations and prevent their use by reactionaries. With the president approving the implementation of temporary emergency measures after 'discussing' the growing crisis with Buta Singh, the administration now has the flexibility to achieve its objectives. With the CPI(M)'s hand revealed it should not be long before the achievements of [From.GetLeader] can be recognised and the country reformed to eliminate the rotten core of the bourgeois democratic system of the nation."

In seizing control of the governmental institutions, government forces in Mumbai were confronted by misguided citizens, fed reactionary lies and propaganda. Unfortunately in the ensuing chaos as our dedicated troops attempted to make their way through our largest city, armed forces fired warning shots to deter these vagabonds, injuring twelve, and as tank units processed through the streets, foreign subversives used the opportunity. Photographing a simple tank, these so-called journalist have fabricated what they claim to be 'evidence' of atrocities by the armed forces, showing one of our tanks driving over what they have alleged to be an 'innocent civilian'. These images have spread like wildfire through the opposition to our legitimate operations and are being used to undermine our actions. Whilst the photographs are blatantly manipulated to smear our administration, they have undermined our cause extensively and misrepresented the socialist cause in India, inflaming public opinion against the government; especially in the city of Mumbai."

Whilst police forces have been brought out to handle the situation and prevent rioting from causing serious damage, the current level of anguish is extremely concerning to [From.GetLeader] and his government.

 india.360.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of our police forces in Mumbai and the diversion of the armed forces from pressing operations in the city and surrounding areas, Mumbai has been gripped by chaos. Intense protests by the populace of Mumbai following the Mumbai Incident transitioned into violent rioting following the failure, and unwillingness of subversive elements in the police force, to contain the protests. Widespread damage has occurred across the city as rioters destroy infrastructure and clash with government forces trying to restore order to the situation, the failure of the people's government in fulfilling its mandate is a blow to our legitimacy in these troubling times and an indictment against our continued rule."

However despite their promise to serve in the interests of India, troops ordered from their barracks to seize Chennai have refused to take part in any such action. This mutinous behaviour is being excused as a humanitarian position, not wishing to partake in operations against the civil authorities. Despite their clear insubordination and defense of subversive elements within the organs of state, some cabinet members have supported the position of not taking harsh action against the mutineers, given the situation as a whole."

With each new case of mutiny emboldening the disloyal servants of the state, divisions are beginning to cleave our troops in two with brawls having been reported in barracks, as comrades deal with their split loyalties. Whilst the government had hoped to swiftly seize the apparatus of governance from the forces of reaction in a swift strike, the level of sedition still prevalent in the military has prevented any such action and our people's government is in a ... precarious situation as the country begins to tear."

Seemingly seeking the destruction of the responsible civilian governance of the Indian nation, troops stationed in the capital left their barracks concurrently following secret orders from the treasonous general. Whilst this has shown that despite [From.GetLeader]'s best intentions in bringing a new socialist order to India, that this can no longer be achieved by peaceful means, the administration however has begun to rally still loyal troops and party members. The socialist order shall come to India; even if we must fight for the workers' cause."

With the last of the capital region's loyalists fleeing, the sporadic gunfire that has marked the cities of India ever since central authority collapsed has died down. With the capital abandoned, troops under the command of general Nirmal Chander Vij have seized the Lok Sabha and alongside opposition politicians have formed an administration claiming to be the legitimate government. As mutineers, reactionaries, elites, and other assorted counter-revolutionaries gather under the banner of the military government in Delhi, the nation has plunged into civil war between the legitimate government in Kolkata and the military autocracy in Delhi."

With loyal troops moving into the city to disarm and arrest mutineers, the loyal armed forces were met by greater resistance than expected. As conflict erupted government soldiers were overwhelmed and vital troops had to be rerouted to aid with the ongoing situation. Whilst most Chennai residents have tried to keep clear of the streets as troops engage in street-to-street fighting, there has unfortunately been collateral damage to the infrastructure of the Tamil Nadu capital, with some deaths from civilians getting caught in the crossfire. Whilst we should eventually be able to restore order to the city in due time, for now the state capital is racked by brutal urban conflict in what some analysts believe could be signs of things to come."

With the decision to deal with mutineers laxly during this key period, the operational effectiveness of government forces has been reduced and loyal forces have failed to take key objectives. Despite our dedication to the socialist cause the failure of the CPI(M)-loyal forces to secure the country for socialism and true liberty puts the Politburo's plan of action in jeopardy and the nation's future balanced on the edge of a knife."

Whilst some argue that the action is an autocratic measure to stifle Indian democracy, the real facts are that this measure shall prevent Fascism from influencing the country and ensuring that the revolution can be properly defended by loyal party members, whilst maintaining a true democracy free of the bourgeois stain."

Our critics have denounced the visit as a publicity stunt and the camp merely a show designed for the press and international observers.

Obviously given the poor relations between Delhi and Islamabad, our continued support for Pakistan is hardly received well and they have asked that we formally cut our support to show our commitment to socialist unity between Delhi and Beijing.

There are some advisors who support such powers being granted to whomever the new Peshwa be, ideas which sound mildly appealing to the Chhatrapati, but who would be reduced to a figurehead without plenty of riches and little responsibility.

While we could work towards the formal establishment of such a system, some organisations have called on the government to not just formalise the system, but grant even greater authority to the panchayats in order to provide greater representation and democracy at the local level.

However with the anti-Hindi agitation of 1965 in the southern states against, more subsequent legislation allowing for the continued use of English was passed.

Stepping down from his position as premier of the nation in favour of the the Aam Aadmi Ka Sipahi convenor Arvind Kejriwal, the actions of the beloved general have brought in AAKS governance. Promising a return to a true Gandhian vision of socialism, convenor Kejriwal's government has been inaugurated in New Delhi as a return to civilian rule as junta officials are slowly replaced by members of the AAKS."

However recognising the intense support for the current government that Panag and the junta enjoy and the unifying effect the beloved general provides the nation, the [From.GetRulingParty] administration has decided to continue on with the military administration. With that, Panag secures for himself a position of continued power and leadership over the [From.GetName], as the people of India can look onwards to a bright future under the comrade general."

Those who doubted the [From.GetRulingParty] government's decision have once again come out of the woodwork to undermine [From.GetLeader]'s authority, even though the program has seen great successes in modernising our infantry forces.

Obviously, the foreign imperialists have made their futile statements denouncing the legitimate Indian government's actions, calling it a violation of international norms and demanding recompense for the damage caused to their operations, the legal government of the [From.GetName] has maintained its position on the issues and, in the wake of the hostile tone taken by these aggressive bourgeois elements across the globe, have promised to continue to protect the Indian people from such flagrant violation of sovereignty and to protect the revolution from harmful foreign elements."

This turn of events is disheartening for the administration and despite the government's benevolence and wishes to bring true prosperity, liberty, and equality to the [From.GetName], these counter-revolutionary elements are a stain on the successes of the subcontinent.

Whilst some have called these actions unnecessarily radical and a waste of resources, bringing nothing of use, such arguments are misguided and unwanted pseudo-counter-revolutionary sentiment and we should continue to take actions to bring about greater unity between all the Indian people no matter their standing in society."

Envisioned by the true Indian leaders to be the basis of the new republic's governance, the panchayati dream was betrayed by decades of Indian politicians furthering their own self-interested agendas, betraying the Indian people with their centralisation of power in the debauchery of New Delhi.

Whilst to join with India under a united front would aid us in defending the nation against aggressive powers, who would deny our right to independent existence, it would also tie us to the much larger and more powerful administration of New Delhi and could undermine our position to make independent decisions regarding our foreign policy."

Whilst the proposal would have assured mutual defense and cooperation for our two nations the government, Yangon's concerns managed to eclipse the many positive factors for their government. Believing that such measures are unnecessary for the [From.GetName] and that they would be to the detriment of Burma's ability to take an independent direction in its foreign dealings, [From.GetLeader]'s decision is still disappointing for [RAJ.GetLeader] and is a setback for socialist cooperation in the regime."

With this message, the path is clear for us. The Egyptian people must be brought together as soon as possible, furious at each other for too long, and divided for even longer.

Based around the principles of a modern and progressive state, but the isolationist and rigid ideals of ancient Egypt, the Republic will supposedly reunite our shattered nation when the time is right. In his first speech to the people after forming an official government this morning, Director [Root.GetLeader] declared 'a new beginning for the Egyptian soul'.

Thousands poured onto the streets of Aswan to offer their support to military units that declared loyalty to the rising army heavyweight.

Initially the provisions of such an agreement were vague, but after hours of debate between religious heavyweights and politicians, a genuine plan was formulated. While church and state would be separated constitutionally, there would be no more oppression directed by any government in Aswan towards religious majorities and minorities.

According to attendees, the highlight of the conference was a panel discussion between prominent economists regarding recent capitalist reforms. While popular with most of the country, there have been substantial negative effects of the following 'privatisation wave'. During the panel a heckler from the audience was taken into custody after threatening to shoot one of the economists, pledging allegiance to a fringe Communist group.

This was proven today when a gathering supportive of [Root.GetLeader]'s administration reached into the hundreds of thousands. Their only demand was reunification, and the Director-President himself came out onto his balcony to reassure those below that this simple wish would be met as soon as possible.

It took more than three days to agree on a plan, but by the end of the week a genuine constitution was drafted by the Assembly and signed by the head of state himself. Today all final amendments were debated and the constitution of the People's Republic is expected to be immediately implemented in just a few hours.

 egypt.1.d:0 "Finally the day of the first Egyptian Presidential election has arrived. Popular candidates participated in a series of heated debates in the past few weeks, drawing the attention of millions. Despite fluctuating polls however, it seems there are two candidates most likely to take the position of head of state in a landslide. Mohamed Morsi, nominee of the Islamic Republicans, has campaigned on a platform of traditionalism and capitalism, garnering support from some religious heavyweights and the disdain of others, such as the current Coptic Pope. His main opponent is Amr Moussa, nominee of the Social Democratic Party. Campaigning alongside numerous labour activists, the self-proclaimed 'people's candidate' has based his large platform around an overhaul of the welfare system and workers' rights. Despite their popular support however, the two frontrunners could face an unexpected challenge from rapidly rising stars Abdel Fotouh and Naguib Sawiris. Both have similar economic policies but differ greatly on social policy. While the four candidates have represented the new democratic system, a fifth party has risen in local polls and could see their Presidential candidate take it all in today's election: The Communist Party."

 egypt.2.d:0 "Islamic preacher Abdul Kareem Tattan is now calling for the downfall of our government. According to him, [Root.GetLeader] has 'led us astray' through secularisation and progressive reforms, supposedly aimed at destroying morals and values within Egypt. His statements at a Mosque in downtown Cairo have been ridiculed by many, but there are some portions of the population who appear to be attracted to this form of rhetoric. Especially since the almost successful Presidential campaign of Morsi, Islamic traditionalism has risen to be the most popular it has ever been since the abolition of the Kingdom of Egypt. Now it is up to the ruling administration to decide whether this preacher will become a serious problem or not."

 egypt.3.t:0 "Muslims Flocking to New Mosque"
 egypt.3.d:0 "Countless furious Muslims are flocking to the new mosque of Abdul Kareem Tattan, telling various journalists waiting outside the building that a new age was dawning upon us. Their anger has been fuelled by recent legislation that tackles religious influence in government, and defunds hundreds of religious schools around Egypt. Inside the mosque they were welcomed by the radical preacher himself, and told to stay as long as they like. This hospitality combined with such ferocious speeches has confused the political establishment, as more and more Egyptian men, women and children seek guidance."

Funded by the central government and advocated for by the President himself, this program was implemented less than a week ago, in an effort to halt fundamentalist opposition to 'democratic values'. In many people's eyes, this is merely blatant hypocrisy, and the words of Tattan are only gaining traction throughout the entire country, despite Cairo's best attempts. His arrest today marks a turning point in relations between religious leaders and the President, forcing them to choose between safety and 'the truth', as the Sheikh's supporters have put it."

Both supporters and opponents of the preacher's rhetoric united together to fight against a 'system of oppression' in the words of one particular activist who has captivated the nation. It is this latter group that has surprised the government most, as secularists themselves demand the Sheikh's immediate release in the name of freedom. Public outrage has reached a boiling point on Cairo's streets, and if the police hadn't initiated a soft crackdown on the protesting, it could have quickly developed into riots."

The blast destroyed the vehicle and killed all occupants, shocking bystanders as they walked past. The tragic news reached Cairo in a matter of minutes, and President [Root.GetLeader] was reportedly both heartbroken and furious that security services couldn't protect the second most senior member of his government. Already state funeral proceedings are being prepared, and the national intelligence agency is setting up a briefing for the head of state to explain what went wrong, and how Cairo can respond. Some suspect foul play by a foreign power, while others in the media are currently speculating that Islamic fundamentalists could have committed this act of terror in retaliation for their Sheikh's imprisonment."

No longer can just preachers be arrested for their statements. Now any single Egyptian citizen with the supposed intent to enact terror in the name of Islam can be imprisoned by local governments. The bill that passed Parliament made it clear that this intent would cover countless people who simply voiced discontent against the arrest of Abdul Tattan. Activist groups are already furious at the legislation, and demand new elections to remove President [Root.GetLeader] from power, in favour of 'a leader who respects democratic traditions'."

The news reached media outlets earlier today, who reported it not long after. According to a government spokesperson, the media is simply stirring up rumours that seek to destabilise the government and bring down the sitting President. Viewers however are naturally sceptical of the administration's position, with millions taking to social media to express support for Tattan."

 egypt.9.t:0 "Sheikh Released From Prison"
 egypt.9.d:0 "Despite the demands of the central government, the local administration in which Sheikh Tattan's prison is located, ordered his immediate release upon learning of the hunger strike. Today he was let out with malnourishment obvious, and yet his spirits appeared to never have been higher. To waiting journalists he said 'there is no greater feeling than to know I have made important people fold'. And the folding has caused utter humiliation for the ruling party, who sent delegates to the local Governor's office in an attempt to halt the process. Their attempts were futile however and the Regional Assembly voted almost unanimously in favour of release, condemning police actions as ill-justified."

His visit was planned by Egyptian political groups to stir up the Palestinian populace in favour of a more pro-Arab state in the region, rather than the current Jewish-Arab power balance. Unfortunately for the lone traveller, his arrival at a controversial Islamist conference in the Gaza Strip became the last trip he would ever make. Minutes after making a speech and leaving the premises, al-Badri was shot by a sniper on the roof of a nearby building. Killed instantly, the preacher's body remained lifeless on the side of the road until emergency services arrived. As of now, the assailant hasn't yet been captured by Palestinian police or security forces, and isn't expected to be by many."

 egypt.11.d:0 "Abdul Kareem Tattan has declared Ibrahim al-Badri a martyr of the Islamic revolution, calling for the people of Egypt to 'stand with their fallen brother'. Speaking to thousands gathered inside and outside his now famous mosque, the recently released preacher suggested that [Root.GetLeader] orchestrated the assassination of al-Badri in the streets of Jerusalem to crush Islamism once and for all. This claim is now becoming widespread not just in Egypt but in other Arab nations, especially those in opposition to Egypt as a regional power. Rumours surrounding the reach of this administration's intelligence services don't help our case."

The leaker is currently unknown, and as we speak more details are being released to the media. Surely with recent events this is only going to incite more hatred against the government, and could possibly lead to a total breakdown of Egyptian society as divisions deepen. The situation as it stands must be resolved before it gets out of hand too quickly."

No longer is the opposition to [Root.GetLeader] purely religious or based around the movement of Sheik Tattan. Now it appears a power vacuum is approaching, as every single opposition movement takes to the streets to protest issues surrounding tyranny and lack of integrity in the current administration. Today a climax was reached with millions protesting in Cairo, calling for the immediate resignation of the sitting President and his entire cabinet, condemning them for assassinating an Egyptian citizen to protect their own interests. Unlike previous events there was no message from the office of the President, and most of Egypt is in the dark."

The General Intelligence Directorate was immediately set to the highest alert, attempting to determine the location of this group but so far has failed to come up with any credible results. On the other hand, countless citizens have pledged support for the terrorists, claiming that they stand for 'the right national path'."

 egypt.16.d:0 "In the middle of last night, thousands of soldiers loyal to General el-Sisi marched down the streets of Cairo, mowing down any civilians that stood in their way. Tanks attacked government offices and aircraft were utilised to bomb the homes of influential national politicians. To the millions watching out their windows as the world appeared to end before their eyes, the apparent coup was set to succeed with spectacular ruthlessness. But by six in the morning, General el-Sisi's forces had been pushed back and surrendered in many quarters of the capital. Brother fought against brother to reclaim control, but the most decisive battle was seen at the state television station. Rebellious forces attempted to occupy it, but security forces crushed the operation with maximum efficiency. By eight, el-Sisi was trapped in his office and forced to admit defeat to the military heavyweights who remained loyal to their constitutional President. Our head of state himself made a televised address to the nation to quell rumours of a successful military revolution and assure the world that this government remained in power."

Their only demand is the establishment of an 'Islamic State' in Egypt and the overthrow of the democratic system. Despite being deemed terrorists by the Governor as they marched past his temporary office, the protesters remained entirely peaceful and abided by the law. This surprising method is believed to be the result of Sheikh Tattan's direct involvement in a coordinated effort to make their fundamentalist movement seem legitimate, and has made [Root.GetLeader] increasingly concerned. Hours after taking to the streets, they called for their 'glorious leader' to come to Alexandria and join in with the movement."

Driving from the airport to an undisclosed location, the extremely controversial Sheikh is expected to make the most significant speech of his lifetime, one that will decide the future of Egypt. If it's a success, then our nation's fate will be a collapse into anarchy, divided between government loyalists and disenfranchised Islamists. If it's a failure, the movement will surely lose traction and a lack of strong leadership will restore control to the central government."

Concerned that the situation in Alexandria and Cairo will lead to political collapse, the regional leaders have demanded more power over their respective defence forces. [Root.GetLeader] himself responded via a phone call with Governors to assure them that there would be no escalation of the situation. Without directly replying to demands of increased decentralisation however, he only made his colleagues in the regions more furious at the central government."

He stated that the age of democracy in Egypt had come to an end, and for the traditions of Islam to remain there had to be radical change. This change of course was declaring himself the first Caliph of the modern era, bringing the millions gathered before him under his wing, and any other Muslims around the world who pledged support. Already we are seeing reports from Islamic countries where citizens are rising up against their government and placing their faith in Caliph Tattan. However, as one state rises another attempts to remain in power. Responding to the surprisingly effective televised speech, the President immediately met with parliamentary colleagues to form a democratic coalition against the fundamentalist menace. All citizens loyal to democracy and freedom were called on to defend Egypt."

Now according to the President, that time has come. Proclaiming the beginning of the Second Stage at a meeting with politicians from around the country, el-Sisi officially formed his new party - 'Egyptian Liberation'.

While highly bold and ambitious, the plan seeks to construct brand new entirely sustainable cities around Egypt, as well as revamping current major city centres.

Thankfully, a well-trained authoritarian police force and loyal army were already prepared to crackdown on the activists with unprecedented efficiency. By midnight protests in Cairo had been swept away by security forces with minimal casualties, and others in nearby regions appear to be returning to their homes for fear of their lives. Naturally this isn't the situation our head of state planned for, but ignorant dissent is always to be expected in a country that has only recently adopted free and fair democracy."

These include a privatisation of all manufacturing and the dissolution of most state companies, to be auctioned off into private corporations. Alongside the controversial political reforms of the Morsi government, these are expected to even out the polls. Ever since the military overthrew Sharaf there has been a rapid rise in support for abolition of the socialist system that governed Egypt since the mid-20th century, and Morsi capitalised on this fact during his first campaign. However, while sentiment remains largely in favour of the Assembly's legislation, economic experts are still concerned about the physical effects of such rapid change in a poorly developed nation."

Despite violations of human rights, suppression of the populace and other factors that made Cairo's last government almost universally despised, our recently elected leader stated on national television that this was the only way we would move forward. If the courts pursued such leaders, Egypt couldn't go ahead with major political, social and economic reforms, as it would naturally be stuck in an endless legal battle determining who is guilty for what crimes. The idea was floated by Fotouh as a candidate in the Presidential election, but he never outright supported it and made no comment when questioned about the subject. So it can be expected that the decision will cause a great divide in the community for quite some time, and could still see a drop in approval ratings for the incumbent administration."

Because I find it hard to believe that in anyone's heart they genuinely believe religion and politics are naturally unconnected. It is simply not true. For without Islam in politics, there is no reasoning behind social policies that will shape a nation for decades to come. This is the fundamental problem a secular nation faces, and Egypt has unfortunately been one of those nations since the dawn of a supposed 'Arab Republic'. Since the dawn of the politician's Republic. But let it be known that this crisis of unimaginable proportions will come to an end today! For today is the last day of the immoral and unjust politician's Republic. And it is the beginning of the Republic of the people.

For while the two are not one and the same, we can still implant the values of our religious code into politics. Through social, political and economic policy we can devote ourselves to God without putting God in our government. And that is the fundamental principle of a secular Republic, an Arab Republic. Henceforth I reject all calls from my people, however good at heart they may be, to proclaim an Islamic Republic on the land upon which I stand.

Of course he never changed his mind on the influence religious heavyweights would have in policy decisions, but this was to be expected and those at the conference were more than pleased with this outcome.

Sources from inside the palace have suggested to international media that the head of state is paranoid of almost everyone around him, since he was informed of rumours that the military was planning a coup against him.

In a stunning turn of events, the President proclaimed a new Egyptian Empire with himself as King Thutmose V, claiming to restore Egypt's prestige and glory as it once held in ancient times.

Despite this significant history with the outside world, Egypt's King has made the final decision to close the Valley of the Kings forever.

The unprecedented transfer of power has been met by concern, anger, unwavering support and confusion. Egypt's populace have been without a royal family to govern them since the Officer's Movement, and most have never considered a possible restoration. But in an era when traditionalism and the ways of the early 20th century appear to be returning, perhaps this is the right path for Egypt.

Drawing on religious texts to provide support for this regime change, he endorsed many Islamist groups within Egypt that fought against a seemingly endless secular system. Today the King was coronated as Sultan in a lavish ceremony attended by numerous international delegates, intrigued by the recent developments in Egypt.

Therefore as Faud stood above hundreds of thousands of his subjects, he declared a new holy era, one that would lead to the end of heresy across the planet. First the Sultan said, we must focus on restoring belief in God and traditionalism in Egyptian society. Secondly our neighbours shall see the light of real Islamic devotion, rather than bowing down to the ideals of secularism.

Delegates from around the world arrived in Cairo to observe the ceremony, both intrigued by the recent developments and seeking to gain a foothold in a brand new political landscape.

Naturally this bill was passed with an overwhelming majority, as those in opposition to it saw no point in attempting to block it.

At a young age his politically active mother was abducted and never to be seen again, forcing Egypt's current head of government into an increasingly tough life with his father, alone in the growing city of Cairo. By the end of the speech which lasted more than ten minutes, many members were in tears and stood to clap, even if from opposition parties.

Eventually once concerns were crushed and enough sitting members supported the bill, it passed by a slim margin, but nevertheless enough to become law.

At least this was the rhetoric pushed by supporters of the legislation in a chaotic session of Cairo's Assembly. As the power of other political parties grows stronger in regional and local elections, their share of the votes in our parliament results in a worrying situation.

Now with the almost unlimited powers of the royal title in his hands, Mohab I has chosen to weaken himself and all those once loyal to the late King. In his first official address to the imperial subjects, our King addressed them as 'my fellow Egyptians', words Thutmose V never once uttered. From that historic point onwards, he proceeded to state how Egypt needed to find its true self once again, a balance between the glory of the old and the progress of the new.

 lower_nile.12.d:0 "By winning the elections, [Root.GetLeader] and the Ba'ath Party have legitimised this popular movement and crushed any credible political opposition. Today, with a total majority in the National Assembly, representatives from each Governate approved legislation that would abolish every single party in the country except for that of their own. Unknown to much of the country and kept behind closed doors until the government was prepared to make a statement, any slight resemblance of democracy in the Lower Nile ended at that moment. Now the one true Party is free to govern how it likes... and wihout the ridiculous 'checks and balances' of weak democratic societies the country shall develop at a much faster rate."

Minutes ago [Root.GetLeader] spoke in a nationally televised address which received mandatory viewing from every single citizen. In this speech he touched on the increasing calls from fellow government ministers to seek unification with our Southern neighbours, be it through war or peace. And to the great relief of all those watching, he followed this by expressing his belief that the Lower Nile had finally reached a point of progress where it is ready to either negotiate or win a war, whichever option it will be."

The President himself made a long but uplifting speech to his colleagues in parliament, and by extension the entire nation, outlining the need for rapid modernisation, development, social unity and military strength in the face of countless enemies. Receiving a standing ovation from all those present, even parties that dramatically lost the close vote, the head of state secured his place as a modern Egyptian revolutionary, one who seeks change through reform and not bullets."

But the Nationalist Party's historic victory has changed the minds of many, proven by meetings held today. At different times and with different issues to discuss, rebel commanders and politicians from around the entire country met. By the end of today a general consensus was reached at every single one of these meetings, which was that the rebel movements must cease in exchange for government policies that support the military."

These include a privatisation of all manufacturing and the dissolution of most state companies, to be auctioned off into private corporations. Alongside the controversial political reforms of the Nour government, these are expected to even out the polls. Ever since the Republic's formation there has been a rapid rise in support for abolition of the socialist system that governed Egypt since the mid-20th century, and Nour capitalised on this fact during his first campaign. However, while sentiment remains largely in favour of the Assembly's legislation, economic experts are still concerned about the physical effects of such rapid change in a poorly developed nation."

Despite being an opponent of the Cairo government and the puppet leadership of his predecessor, he told the nation that there was simply a need for the most powerful man in the Republic to utter those words.

Not long after they were taken to undisclosed military installations throughout the Republic to meet their maker, each shot in the head with precision either by soldiers or decorated Generals, depending on who was available at the time.

This constitution would enforce the ideals of Communism, workers' rights and more key values of the ruling Workers' Party. Despite his unorthodox methods the Speaker did manage to mobilise his colleagues to finalising a draft mere days after, concluding literally sleepless nights for every politician involved and countless phone calls between national and regional representatives. Today the first Communist constitution of an Egyptian nation was signed by our head of state and shall come into effect at the end of the week."

Today members of the National Assembly spoke on behalf of the currently unavailable head of state, calling on all fellow colleagues in the room to approve following legislation. Calls fell more or less on deaf ears, but it made little difference considering the Nationalist Party has a substantial majority.

Effective immediately, those involved in economic corruption no matter what size would be hunted down and arrested for their crimes against the Arab people.

After meeting once with cabinet for an emergency session that resulted in no firm conclusion, al-Assad left for Damascus' Presidential Palace. That was almost a week ago, and since then he has refused to even put one foot outside the entrance. Ministers are unable to see him and even close family relatives have no way of knowing what is happening within Palace walls. Servants have been pestered for information but so far refused, more than likely paid a handsome bonus by Bashar to keep quiet in these worrying times."

By the time they had reached the closest Damascus Hospital, it became clear that Assad had overdosed, but not fatally just a few minutes before his rescue. Concerned about the future of their nation in the event of Assad's death, cabinet members waited eagerly for news from the hospital, finally being told tonight that he is no longer in a critical condition."

From an outright military coup to forced resignation, various proposals were thrown around the room, and yet nothing could conclusively be decided upon. Despite the lacklustre outcome for those involved, all pledged to meet again in the near future to assess the situation.

Fully aware of their meeting with Generals and Admirals just yesterday, Bashar schemed to suggest that he was considering a peaceful transfer of power, in order to get fellow politicians into the Presidential Palace. The plan worked, as all members of cabinet arrived eagerly and without any suspicion of ulterior motives. Upon their arrival however, elite guards loyal to the President opened fire on the motorcade as Ministers prepared to exit.

Supposedly, they have intercepted communications in Havana that suggest an assassination plot is brewing, and any more days in the city would pose a terrible threat to the President. Ministers have issued a recommendation to the couple, urging them to cancel the tour and return to Syria as soon as possible.

Their calls were no longer for reform, but of death to the once beloved President and his 'corrupt family'. Despite mounting protests however, Bashar was still safe and sound in the Presidential Palace, observing developments from the confines of his lavish family home. Today, the future of Syria was changed forever. In the earliest hours of the morning, hundreds, perhaps thousands of rioters managed to scale the Palace fences, overwhelming security forces with weaponry more than likely supplied by foreign powers. Less than ten minutes later, the President was being hanged from an archway in the very centre of the complex. His dangling body was subsequently set alight, burning to a crisp as Syria itself followed.

As the sun above Syria's capital today, thousands of supposedly loyal soldiers stood alongside revolutionaries in their effort to overthrow the Regency Council. This alliance was more than likely what gave socialists the upper hand in an urban battle that would take place not long after.

Supporters of current President [Root.GetLeader] however are vehemently opposed to any such action, claiming that Riad al-Turk is hardly in line with the ideological stance of Syria's new administration.

Minutes ago state media reported that despite the best efforts of emergency services and those few brave heroes who jumped to rescue Assad, the President bled to death on that very street.

Despite shock and anger from the international community however, it seems as though her statement had some truth behind it, as there has been no action taken from any corner of the political establishment to reject her claim.

Upon hearing this the people were extremely sceptical, as such promises had been made in the past and yet no free and fair elections came to fruition. Nevertheless, today Asma al-Assad spoke from her office to the nation, calling for a legislative election that would 'define the future of our thriving country for many more years to come'.

As names were read out one after the other, loyal Presidential Guards dragged each member outside the chamber. By the end of this shocking event all remaining members of the Party were shouting out the President's name in such declarations as 'We love you Asma', 'Long live the Syrian mother' and 'Death to the traitors'.

Standing alongside his colleagues and spouse, President Bashar al-Assad made his first address as an emboldened executive leader, no long constrained by the constitutional limits of former Arab regional laws. In this speech, he decried factional infighting and 'anti-Syrian imperialism', calling on countrymen to unite under one ideology, rather than that of a political party. Such words caused some in the chamber to express bitterness not long after, as the decree was essentially a tool designed to placate Bashar's excessive ego.

Mere hours ago, al-Hassan barged into Rifaat's office with a letter of resignation, and another document signed by various political and military leaders advising the President to step aside peacefully. However, the previously forgotten Assad brother stood his ground, only signing his demise when the Colonel threatened him with merciless military force.

Leftist syndicalists have condemned the Business Council as a bastardisation of their values and policies, calling on the international community to retaliate against the growing authoritarianism of Syria's military junta.

However other sources also indicate that there is a growing anti-authoritarian movement funded by particular neighbouring nations, aimed at destabilising Syria for their own interests.

This truly magical ceremony has already been well received around the world, captivating millions across the seas and surely inspiring a new generation of monarchists for many years. King Mired of Syria arrived on the footsteps of the former Presidential Palace two hours later, rejecting security advice to make a speech from the famous balcony above.

Not long after a new department was established in total secrecy, Section 9 of the Interior Ministry.

Unlike other Privy Councils around the world and in various points throughout history, ours includes members of numerous professions, expertise and interests, providing the recently crowned monarch an inside perspective on the daily workings of his subjects. There is even speculation and jubilation amongst democratic activists concerning the King's accountability, as it has been hinted by a government press release that he will have to answer to the Privy Council and could face serious consequences if deemed to be 'betraying the people's trust'."

While not officially releasing any documents to detail this shift in the political landscape, it can be confirmed by sources within the government that Syria's only recently coronated monarch is preparing for a mass purge of opposition. This will more than likely cause outrage from pro-democracy activists, but their dissent will nevertheless be short lived due to the unlimited powers of the secret police. Supporters of constitutional monarchy have already decried growing authoritarianism within the ruling administration and claim this is the final straw, retracting their praise for Syria's royal revival."

Thankfully, the bill avoided collapse within Council, as supporters fought mercilessly to keep it relevant in the chamber and across domestic media.

While not necessarily obligated to resign from official posts within the executive branch, Abdul-Azim subsequently stepped aside as Syrian President, preceding a total collapse of his former party. Members from each faction split off to form their own minor parties, while a significant majority established the 'Syrian Republican Party'. Abdul-Azim's fall from grace spells the end of federalism within our divided country, as Hadi al-Bahra - a firm opponent of the federal model - takes the mantle. He is expected to form a cabinet in the coming weeks, as despite being the largest party in the People's Council, the Republicans still don't hold enough seats to be considered in government."

Nevertheless, the majority of comparative law scholars argue that the Swiss code derives from a distinct paradigm of civil law. Today, in a formal declaration alongside all members of the national cabinet, [Root.GetLeader] announced that just as Atatürk did in 1926, Syria would soon be adopting a slightly modified version of the Swiss code. Advocating for such reforms since his first election campaign, the President outlined that many of the code's elements already exist in Syrian law, but adopting it would represent a huge step in modernising and Westernising the country."

Such projects would include infrastructure initiatives, dams, construction of major manufacturing complexes and more, all key to the progress of Syria's stagnating economy. Supposedly it took hours for [Root.GetLeader] to convince his parliamentary colleagues that the best way forward was a unanimous approval of these projects, despite not legally requiring the Council's support to begin construction.

However, the supposed 'Radical Coalition's leader Khawla Dunia was deadly serious in her call for the most powerful man in Syria to step aside. In fact, it appears as though the socialists have been emboldened by increasing support in the Far North, most notably along the border with Kurdistan and in some areas of Aleppo.

Immediately after the terrorist detonated his suicide vest, the black sedan was utterly destroyed and its occupants killed instantly. Innocent Syrians simply walking along the street or perhaps attempting to catch sight of our beautiful First Lady were killed, as well as many more brutally injured by this cowardly attack.

Unfortunately these plans were delayed due to an assassination attempt involving fundamentalist insurgents in the Northern regions. Much to the delight of each of our administrations however, the two finally met for the first time today.

The announcement was short but sweet, outlining a roadmap for bringing thousands of eager women into the armed forces for any role they desired. While legislation is yet to be formally passed by politicians in Damascus, it will without a doubt be approved without any opposition, and soon the female leaders of this great nation will finally be permitted to fight alongside their fellow troops.

Such rumours have struck our glorious ruler to the core, bewildered by the fact that there could be false friends and scheming supporters within the highest ranks of Syria's political system.

While the first order is expected to take years to complete, there is already speculation within some circles that [Root.GetLeader] is already planning to construct thousands more.

The latter has angered dissidents far more than the former however, as it is seen by many as a form of political corruption.

Millions of Syrians applauded the news of a boost in the program's spending, praising [Root.GetLeader] for such genius and calling on other nations to bow down to our new-found might.

While the specific amount has not been disclosed by any official - and more than likely never will be - it is believed that it will be enough to fund the construction of hundreds of small surface ships and perhaps submarines. The news comes as military support for the regime is recorded at a record high, cementing the monarchy as a force to be reckoned with in the case of popular revolt.

Notably in Aleppo, the site of a devastating rebellion not many years ago, a party heavyweight deposed a longtime provincial Governor, claiming that 'a new era has dawned upon the Syrian people'. Ba'ath Party members in the People's Council met with President Assad today in crisis mode, demanding that a harsh crackdown on far left activities be prepared by the armed forces.

However, response from relevant military leaders has been minimal, and some within the high ranks of Ba'athist leadership are questioning whether they have been turned by Communist agents within every branch of the armed forces.

It seems the political establishment misjudged growing far left influence, as an apparent lack of leadership was a clear indicator of a failed movement.

In an extraordinary Communist Party Congress last night, card-holding members adopted Lenin's ideal as a core tenet of the party constitution, until now non-existent in any documents. Revisionist cliques and other former allies of the revolution blasted [Root.GetLeader] and fellow members of Congress for adopting democratic centralism, claiming that this will be 'the end of liberty' for Syria's people.

In order to confirm the views of each loyal member, General Secretary and President [Root.GetLeader] rejected pan-Arabism in a speech to the Party Congress today.

As control over the factories is returned to workers - their rightful owners - the nation's manufacturing capabilities are expected to increase tenfold, with numerous party sources confirming that the mass nationalisation program will boost output to an extent this country has never seen before. Some party members remain sceptical however, informing the General Secretary that production simply cannot grow as quickly as expected, referring to reports from Communist nations around the globe.

In the end, between scientific progress and industrial progress, the former was picked as one of our key goals to focus on.

Naturally after the announcement was made by a government spokesperson, there was combined fury from religious leaders inside Syria's borders and in the broader international community, but the former's dissent has been met with the true iron fist of our revolutionary party.

While many Ba'athists could hardly have expected a solid result from the meeting, it seems Damascus' delegates had firm plans to reach a deal to end this chaos no matter what. Within a few hours of discussion and back room meetings, representatives of each political party announced that a coalition - the National Alliance - would be formed, allowing the SSNP some representation within the People's Council. Supporters of the latter expressed great joy upon hearing this news, celebrating in the streets and waving the famous Swastika-like banner of the party with great fervor. Ba'athists on the other hand are more than displeased, some even expressing the need for a new party to counter against the 'complacent establishment'.

In return for forming a cabinet dominated by SSNP politicians and granting equal representation in the parliamentary People's Council, Bashar al-Assad will remain as President, and the Council will be barred from removing him within the next decade. Military leaders will also remain loyal to the Ba'ath Party, a clause that was in fact suggested by SSNP representatives to placate a restless clique of military officers. While this agreement appears to offer equal power between the President and his new-found allies in the Social Nationalist Party, true power is evidently invested in the latter, and Bashar shall remain only as a figurehead leader."

Spectacularly, despite controlling an equal share of seats in the People's Council, the SSNP managed to approve construction of a factory consistently rejected by Ba'athist politicians due to it being situated in a deeply pro-SSNP area. This was more than likely due to a last minute intervention from Bashar al-Assad, seen now as a puppet of whoever is in direct control of the political apparatus. The Presidential Palace released a statement today to confirm that the President supported construction but denied the intervention was due to any allegiance to the Party."

The campaign was designed by propaganda masterminds, some even imported from Korea for a lavish sum, and we can only hope that it was worth the money. From television to the internet and newspapers to radio, Love Syria will supposedly unite the population between core party ideals, predominantly romantic and social nationalism. Whether it's successful is up to the people themselves, but initial reports indicate that the campaign has been met favourably by several demographics in both urban and rural areas. Aleppo was hit the hardest with a surge of propaganda due to its consistency as a hive of dissent, particularly after the Aleppo Rebellion saw anti-government values sweep across the city and province as a whole."

Critics of the move towards universal healthcare include party members with significant corporate interests, fiscal conservatives from minor political organisations and some members of the still powerful Assad dynasty. Despite opposition, today the People's Council drafted legislation to finally bring this great policy to the Syrian people.

Those putting up the greatest fight were military commanders still swearing total allegiance, with many fighting til their last dying breath in their own homes. By the end of day almost a fifth of the entire political, military and economic establishment was purged from existence, either dead or waiting to be executed in a military prison on the outskirts of their respective home cities. Thankfully government estimations indicate that the entirety of the former traitorous government could be wiped out within two weeks, as long as stragglers don't flee as quickly as possible."

Of course opposition to the reforms from stubborn education administrators can be expected, but just as their allies in the conspiring Ba'ath Party were wiped clean off the face of the Earth, so can they.

As names were read out one after the other, loyal Presidential Guards dragged each member outside the chamber. By the end of this shocking event all remaining members of the Party were shouting out the President's name in such declarations as 'We love you Asma', 'Long live the Syrian mother' and 'Death to the traitors'.

Today our head of state spoke briefly to a room of press inside the Presidential Palace concerning the future of his party and a likely internal revolt, quelling these rumours as sensationalist and contrary to events that were soon to follow. Mere hours later he had made a dramatic speech to the intrigued People's Council, calling on all members to unite behind this one cause and put behind petty political differences to solve Syria's fundamental flaws once and for all. This speech's significant can not be overstated, as a two thirds majority is required to implement such a major constitutional amendment.

Today the letter of resignation handed to Bashar personally by his teary Chief of Staff was a fatal blow to the pride of our leader. Legally he could remain President for years to come, but the utter disgrace faced in recent months led to Assad's swift signing of the document with little care for its specific details.

The urban administrator of Wenatchee flew to Los Angeles to personally meet [Root.GetLeader] and offer assurances that ruthless force would be used to once again destroy the revolt. However, the latter furiously declared that no military from the area would be engaging with Cascadians.

This could be a significant reason why residents openly celebrated rebel arrival, damning the Communist Party as tyrants and oppressors of their small community. Upon hearing this terrible news, General Secretary [Root.GetLeader] was naturally livid, telling close advisors that if the central government could have stepped in sooner this whole situation would have been avoided.

The bill passed with almost unanimous congressional approval, and now many Arizonans are already calling for their administration to ratify legislation across the border.

In different sectors of the economic, political and social spheres, these delegates will debate and eventually draft a constitution for the President's seal of approval. Today the very first constitutional convention in our nation's history opened with a short speech from the head of state, in which he called on all members to peacefully discuss the issues of greatest importance to American citizens.

Together they campaigned on a platform of national unity and reconciliation, calling on their constituents to band together against the threat of tyranny once again enveloping our picturesque Western coast. Most notably, the Mayor of San Diego arrived in Sacramento today to meet his equivalent, a member of the 'enemy' Conservative Union.

President [Root.GetLeader] addressed the headquarters of his party before being taken to the Congressional Assembly, where he would officially terminate the first legislative term and open the second.

Delegates from each congressional district gathered in the hall to endorse several positions the party would take on in its very first platform. The most significant of these was a call by the San Francisco delegation to accept social liberalism as the guiding force behind their political message.

Instead, while cooperation with the USSR will of course be maintained, terms of trade are expected to be improved and no longer will American industry be almost entirely owned by Russian stakeholders.

While not a long speech, the topic of conflict with neighbouring countries has sparked outrage across the shattered United States and beyond. Many within the nations specifically mentioned by our comrade called on their governments to mobilise against a growing threat, while others appeared to believe he was simply spewing the same rhetoric Angela Davis did for just over twenty years.

From Los Angeles to the furthest reaches of our borders, administrators still subservient to the disgraced Angela Davis have been locked away for good, left to ponder what monstrous actions put them there.

Rumours spread like wildfire in the hours preceding, as both allies and opponents had little idea as to what our gracious leader might mean. However within minutes of delegates taking a seat, Tyner unleashed a tirade against his predecessor and the centralist clique as a whole, calling for an end to their 'disgraceful' cult of personality and a revolutionary age in American society. Despite previously demanding that the contents of this 'new vision' remain hidden from the public eye, word of the General Secretary's secret speech first reached media outside the Union.

Instead the previous General Secretary practiced ghastly economic mismanagement, with far too many resources allocated to urban expansion, which in the end never progressed our Union's economy as she hoped. This time however, the Budget approved by Communist Party members will in reality support military efforts to both expand in size and capabilities. Soon every branch of the armed forces will be equipped to ready itself for the final war of liberation against our neighbours.

Most notably, Glora La Riva was the last official to publicly do so, causing a split between her and Davis for countless years until their reconciliation. Nevertheless, today marks another turning point in the history of our Union, as the Communist Party officially condemns the actions of its own leader and subservient officials in the 1990s, more than likely paving the way for further destruction of the Angela Davis cult.

In similar fashion to those of years gone by, this purge began with the arrest of hundreds of officials in multiple cities, both late at night and early in the morning. Their trials are still yet to be held, but they can be expected in the coming weeks, when they will surely be convicted of treason against the state. To most of the Party, this comes as a relief. For years the Centralist faction has been pushing for a total wipeout of opposition, a clique of traitors they blame for economic failures and the Cascadian situation.

Within this three year period, there will supposedly be rapid economic growth and development of the nation as a whole, key to ensuring victory against capitalist tyranny.

Naturally their outrage has led to calls for Tyner's immediate resignation, but the overwhelming power of the Liberationist faction shut these proposals down as quickly as possible. While the political scene struggles with this debacle and the General Secretary evades opposition, America's citizens are celebrating. With even limited private ownership allowed, they believe there will be new-found economic prosperity not seen in many decades, as the centrally planned economy has negatively affected many rural areas across our nation. Urban centres on the other hand remain bitter, as Davis' economic plan greatly benefited major cities through development plans and significant financial support.

Underground dissident groups have for years quietly campaigned for the abolition of the two-Republic system as a form of compromise, as they believe it will greater benefit the people of 'Washington and Oregon'. Rather than one central government championing the causes of Los Angeles, two more decentralised administrations in the North would supposedly allow for a more effective allocation of resources.

Sections of the report outlined a plan to initiate projects nearby Las Vegas, such as restarting the Hoover Dam - which has remained dormant for many years. One intriguing section written by the Committee's expert on 'People's Relations' states that the current state of Las Vegas must not be hidden away from the public eye, rather brought to the attention of millions as an example of how capitalism quickly fails and turns to rotting shells of its former shelf."

The brainchild of bipartisan Congressional leaders, today's vote will lead to mass-privatisation over time in every single sector of the economy. While extensive media coverage has praised the legislation and supported representatives set to approve it today, there have been growing rumours of another bipartisan clique that intended to halt the resolution before it could pass. Apparently their concerns lay in the number of sectors privatised in the extremely short time designated, as well as the issue of who would take control of these new-found private corporations. An anonymous staffer from within the office of a leftist Congressional representative told the Los Angeles Times this morning, that their employer believed the Ranch Act's passing would create an oligarchic state in which a handful of businesspeople control the majority of major businesses. Nevertheless, further rumours have been swirling since the legislation passed that supporters intimidated members of their own parties into voting 'yes', threatening to fund their opponents in the next Congressional elections.

However, Angela Davis' radical push for 'de-militarisation' of the populace saw that statistic drop astronomically until it eventually reached zero by the mid-1990s. Her efforts were surprisingly lambasted by some socialists within the government, who saw arming the American people as a necessary evil to combat against the threat of Eastern invasion. Nevertheless this invasion never occurred and Davis managed to consolidate the UAPR as the only post-collapse nation to totally remove guns from civilian hands. Today however history has once again been made, with Congressional leaders announcing a bipartisan deal has been reached between the major parties to abolish large swathes of the 'Weapons Reduction Act of 1987' and completely tear up the relatively extreme 'Military Civilian Relations Act of 1991'.

Publicly police seemingly have no idea how these 'master thieves' entered the vault - lauded as one of the most secure in the world - but anonymous sources have suggested that they were aided by a mole on the inside. The events of last night represent a terrible loss for the Paradise Hotel, not just in monetary value but in relations with the public and government.

Surprisingly, the President has refused to endorse any candidate, which would have proved to be an election-defining boost to whichever candidate that could be. The two hopefuls in the lead Toni Atkins and Dean Heller have nevertheless minimised their criticism of [Root.GetLeader]'s stewardship, as doing so would upset the millions that offer unwavering support to America's first post-Communism President. Atkins started out near the bottom of the race until her 'Crucified by History' speech on the steps of San Francisco City Hall. Braving the miserable rain without an umbrella, Atkins stood before thousands to lambast not just the fallen socialist regime, but 'the forces that seek to crucify our nation in the pages of history', referencing her fellow Presidential candidates further to the right and left. On the other hand however, her social democratic nationalist platform has been unequivocally rejected by right wing trailblazer Dean Heller. Hailing from Nevada, Heller has inspired a generation of young anti-Communists who wish to see any radical conservative government installed in Los Angeles. Since the beginning of the race he has held a formidable position, at times being the favourite to win.

In the past few months, scandals have rocked several campaigns, knocking out formidable candidates in the blink of an eye and securing sustained popularity for the two current frontrunners. Kevin McCarthy offers a staunchly conservative and nationalist political platform, having been made famous nationally by his rousing speeches in Congress addressed at leftist politicians across the aisle. Overturning abortion laws once and for all, securing in the constitution a traditional definition of marriage, greatly expanding the military's reach and constructing border walls in the South have all been key components of this platform, echoing a more extreme response to the previous right wing campaign of Dean Heller. In stark contrast to McCarthy is fellow Californian politician Doris Matsui, running without shame as a 'tax and spend' liberal. Despite the attack ads however, her campaign has only gained momentum as the American people seek a leader who will rapidly expand their stagnating economy and offer new job opportunities. It seems they are willing to achieve this at the expense of increased taxes, a fact that is both confusing and infuriating the McCarthy campaign.

Ensign prides himself on being an outsider compared to previous presidential candidates, frequently referencing his work in Congress when he opposed conservative and leftist legislation. Coming from a veterinarian background, he has surprisingly managed to garner a significant progressive vote through his animal welfare policies, despite his stances on abortion and other social issues. Ensign's key opponent Barbara Lee is a presidential hopeful no one could ever have expected to reach this far in the race just four years ago. An apologist for some aspects of the Communist regime, former member of the Black Panther Party and a radical on many economic and social issues, Lee is certainly the 'far left candidate'. Despite what many political pundits deem as crutches for her campaign, these traits have only emboldened her as a truly anti-establishment rising star.

On the leftist ticket is Eric Swalwell, running to implement various socially progressive policies alongside a relatively moderate economic platform. Staunchly in opposition to Swalwell's proposed corporate regulation laws is Elon Musk, a South African immigrant who arrived in California just a few years after the fall of Communism. Unimaginably wealthy from several business endeavours, Musk has been able to entirely self-fund his campaign, one that has deeply divided the country. A social progressive but considerably right wing economically, the presidential hopeful is either hailed as a businessman this country needs to lead it, or an arrogant capitalist without a care for humanity. This polarisation has allowed Juan Vargas to secure a voter base with liberals disgruntled by Musk's economic conservatism. Initiating his run for the presidency relatively late, Vargas has already laid out key legislation he will present to Congress, some of which include securing gun ownership rights, a war on drugs, anti-discrimination laws and an investigation into banking misconduct. Providing a breath of fresh air from left politics however, is Mimi Walters.

Harris' whirlwind campaign across the nation saw some controversy, but an effective media campaign against her opponents quickly killed off any serious consequences to those incidents. So effective was this campaign that international observers have criticised it for supposedly being 'only relatively free and fair' compared to the socialist administration, but 'deeply troubling' compared to other democratic societies. These accusations reportedly angered the President so much that she called for an investigation this month into media and political organisations that seek to 'undermine the democratic integrity of our great nation'.

Although he was not eligible to run for President in the upcoming race, he had already endorsed the Golden Gate League's nominated candidate and showed no signs of resigning before election day in just over a week. The GGL's campaign has been thrown into chaos with their supposedly firm candidate quitting either out of anger or coordinated dealings with Evan Low, and the party forced to endorse Kamala Harris once again. Opponents of the administration however have spun a more elaborate conspiracy theory surrounding today's developments, claiming that this move was inevitable and Low was merely a proxy to pass necessary constitutional amendments so Harris wouldn't have to face expected backlash - although in the end constitutional change was praised by America's populace.

Within days of this review, Foster had signed a bill stating that all of these statues must be torn down and recycled for scrap metal. The most prominent of these statues was one only recently erected, the statue of George Bush, the first president of the American Republic. Foster flew down to Atlanta and was present when the statue was toppled by construction crews, who he then congratulated on their good work. Afterwards, he met with the state governor where the two discussed what should take its place. With the past slowly being removed, Foster is one step closer to eradicating the memory of the United States of America."

 pacific_america.116.d: "Stone Mountain has stood just sixteen miles from Atlanta since its completion in 1972. The region is a place of natural beauty and this natural beauty has been squandered for over four decades. The carving that was forced upon the stone by those who wished to honour the Confederacy has disgraced the state park it inhabits. With the mountain itself having links to the KKK, where it was founded a second time, it is vital that this carving and the history that inhabits the mountain be altered to remove its ties to this horrific ideology. Premier Foster, having visited the mountain, commented on what the government's plans would be for the monument. “First we must scrub clean this carving of bigotry and hate, and then we shall replace the carving with the true revolutionaries. Those who argue that the people depicted on this monument are anything other than traitors are liars. The true men of revolution are Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh, Che Guevara and Kim Il Sung. These are the men we should idolise, not the slave owners of the Confederacy.”"

 pacific_america.117.d: "One of the final monuments that Premier Foster has deemed disgraceful is the Lincoln Memorial. Whilst Foster agrees that Lincoln played a tremendous role in the emancipation of the slaves during the Civil War, Foster refuses to separate him from the crimes of the United States, arguing that the Lincoln Memorial must be changed. Unlike many other members of the Communist Party, Foster is the only outspoken critic of Lincoln, stating that “whilst in the past, our party has tolerated him, this was only to make communism seem more American to the populace. Now that communism has been achieved across the country, I can safely say that Lincoln will no longer be worshipped as he was.” Alongside the Lincoln Memorial, Foster has demanded that several other memorials to past presidents that held slaves or racist beliefs be taken down, such as the Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the Washington monument. In their place, Foster has announced statues to several civil rights activists, such as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, who fought to ensure civil rights were enshrined into US law."

Architects worked hard on constructing a perfect model of the memorial, and after much debate, it was decided that the memorial would start with Marx, the founder of the revolution, and continue along throughout history with notable figures such as Karl Liebknecht, Fidel Castro, all Soviet leaders and ending with Davis and Foster, the two people who successfully brought communism to America. The memorial is now available for the public to visit, already attracting large crowds of interested citizens. Local schools organise class excursions and educational field trips to the memorials, as each statue has a corresponding plaque with a detailed explanation of their life, struggle and dedication to the communist cause. Foster has praised this memorial as a resounding success for the people, allowing them to learn about the true revolutionaries who fought so hard to secure their freedom from the oppressive beast known as capitalism."

Similar to the various parties of the former National Front within the GDR, CPU officials hope that the existence of a controlled opposition will help ease the continued attacks on the government from liberal groups. However, it is clear that Tyner, however reformist he may wish to appear, has no interest in openly allowing elected opposition parties, declaring in a speech that he would never "betray the great principles of proletarian democracy and democratic centralism"."

Many Unionist politicians have exited the legislature, decrying Tyner as a revisionist and a traitor to the values of Gus Hall.

Advocating for a uniquely American socialism in contrast to the Soviet system, labeled a stagnating gerontocracy, the move in foreign policy is likely to greatly offend Berlin and Moscow. Hesitant to join the Pact even as an observer, Davis had pursued an independent policy even with Foster's guidance. Now, with the advice of Harris, has now moved toward self-sufficiency from the Soviet world order.

While viewed by many sceptics as a potential purge, Davis has so far used the campaign not to eradicate remaining anti-Davis elements, but instead legitimately improve revolutionary consciousness in minority communities. Included in the party's campaign is community action, an increased focus on progressive and diverse education in line with Davis' previous projects, especially in the social sciences and history, and, of course, generous grants for Chicano and African-American organizations. Most of these organizations are substantially integrated into the party or associated with party allies, leading many revolutionary socialists to decry the social justice program. In fact, the project is believed to be the brainchild of Davis and Bobby Seale, a long-time administration member and former Panther himself."

Not long after Cascadia and its Popular Front government claimed victory in the destructive fight for independence, economic policy has seemingly become the only political discussion, as social issues tack a backseat. Franz' Labor Front has since been pushing for more aggressive legislation maintaining state-owned corporations and constitutionally banning the privatisation of energy infrastructure. The Prime Minister's party on the other hand seek privatisation across the board and limiting the regulation of wages and workplace health and safety. This division on the floor of parliament has naturally made its way into the cabinet room, where there is apparently an explicit rift between Prime Minister Walden and the high-ranking Franz. Whether this rift will translate into a total collapse of the Popular Front is unlikely, but if the coalition is unable to vote unanimously next week on key pieces of legislation, there could easily be further trouble ahead."

A damning article written by The Seattle Age includes excerpts from interviews with several 'anonymous sources' that claim the divide between Franz and Walden on economic legislation has grown worse over the past four days, and now they are openly verbally attacking each other in daily cabinet meetings. Such a situation - if true - would surely be catastrophic for the future prospects of the Popular Front, which is already on extremely thin ice considering the broad church of ideologies it encompasses. Leader of the Labor Front in parliament and a prominent figure of the revolution Hilary Franz has declined to comment on these rumours, either signalling some truth or perhaps indicating she doesn't wish to entertain these 'anonymous sources'. Most political pundits however see it as the former, with one commentator on the 6.30 Roundtable calling that Cascadia could see a government meltdown within the next two weeks - followed by a terribly divisive snap election."

The threat seems to have fallen on deaf ears, as more rumours continue to pour out from within the administration, one of which being that the Prime Minister is refusing to take calls from Franz' office. Despite leading only a small party in the Popular Front, Wagner could still wield significant influence if he managed to form an opposition coalition with his colleagues in the Conservative and Progressive parties, a scenario that is being heavily toyed with by political commentators. His recent comments about the rumours suggest a hint of bitterness against the Prime Minister, as he stated the sources were surely from within Independence Party offices in an effort to damage the Labor Front leader politically. Whatever the outcome of this week, there is no doubt in any Cascadian minds that far more trouble is ahead for all parties involved."

The Prime Minister looked almost aghast as he watched his cabinet colleague walk away just moments before he was scheduled to speak. Journalists appeared delighted by the event unfolding in front of them, with many stations catching the snub live for the whole nation to see, another factor that has greatly ballooned the significance of Franz' decision.

Leaders of two parties fundamentally in opposition ideologically, this result of the last couple weeks could never have been unexpected, but many never imagined it would happen this quickly and with such little warning. According to sources within the Prime Minister's office, the recent snub tipped Walden over the edge into a terrifying rant that night, followed by a day of setting in motion plans to oust Hilary Franz from her prestigious position. Refusing to comment on her firing, the powerful revolutionary met with the Labor Front parliamentary caucus hours later behind closed doors. Rumours of course are now circulating about what occurred in that meeting, but until parliament resumes tomorrow there will more than likely not be any confirmation. Cascadia's political troubles have finally reached international news, with Canadian political commentator Alex Jones - who famously interviewed Bashar al-Assad before Syria's declaration of independence - telling viewers he believes 'there is no hope at all for this coalition anymore, and I would be very, very surprised if Walden can survive another week'."

Initially only seen as a symbolic move from Hilary Franz' party, the actions undertaken have in fact triggered a fairly unknown section of the constitution regarding parliamentary procedure. Without the Labor Front's members in the chamber, a quorum is not present and parliament is indefinitely paralysed until they return. Prime Minister Walden looked bewildered as his Popular Front colleagues walked out without warning, murmuring to his colleagues then laughing at the Speaker, who called repeatedly for 'absent members' to return to their seats immediately. However, events that unfolded today in the capital are surely no laughing matter for the Prime Minister, who now faces a government that cannot pass legislation and is effectively frozen.

Although technically permitted in the Cascadian constitution, such an action undertaken by our head of state would throw the nation into chaos and almost certainly a constitutional crisis. Despite enraged criticisms from political commentators labelling Stine 'the modern equivalent of a Weimar politician' and 'an advocate for presidential dictatorship', Stine has repeatedly denied he wants a permanent authoritarian state. Rather, ruling by decree would allow the government to keep running under President Brown until a snap election can be held, upon which the powers would be revoked until they may become necessary again. The President is reportedly not entertaining the idea in any capacity, and is instead letting parliamentary leaders sort out their issues. Some believe however there could be more planning and scheming in the President's office than she lets on."

Hilary Franz and leader of the Libertarian Party Wes Wagner have formed an informal alliance 'against all forms of tyranny', calling for the ousting of Greg Walden and impeachment of Kevin Stine for suggesting 'reactionary measures'. While the Independence Party can still comfortably govern, the loss of the Libertarians from the Popular Front has dealt an unexpected blow to the former's chances at the next election. Polling for Wagner has been steadily rising for the past month, and his alliance with Franz has not just aided her in securing more influence on the parliamentary floor, but also secured national attention for the Libertarians. Whether this informal alliance will become an official coalition remains to be seen - and at this point is highly unlikely - but the two will surely cause great problems for Prime Minister Walden together, and could be able to push other parliamentary leaders to mounting a successful vote of no confidence against the government."

Brown called on all members of parliament to fulfil their duties and serve the country 'rather than overwhelming self-interests' and condemned the Labor Front for intentionally suspending the legislative process. At the ending of her speech, the President invited Prime Minister Walden to regular weekly meetings to discuss legislation and anything either the head of state or government believe is relevant to the other. The first of these meetings will be in four days, scheduled by Brown herself and interpreted by many across the nation as a time for the Prime Minister to suggest a new election be held.

In the brief statement Brown did make to press earlier, the President expressed her desire to use this meeting as a means of getting to know Walden - since the two have only met twice since rising to the positions they currently hold. Whether she liked what she saw in the Prime Minister is up to speculation, but as of now the people can rest easy knowing chaos in their capital is surely drawing to a close. Reporters at the executive mansion were however confused not long after Walden returned to his office, as the President boarded Marine One seemingly towards an unscheduled appointment.

However, as the ominous weather looming over the capital should have warned us - that was not the announcement Brown intended to make on those ice cold steps. Shifting her glasses up an inch and placing her hands at the lectern, the President stared with a piercing gaze into the lenses and began to speak. 'Over the recent weeks I have seen a government supposedly in my name collapsing in on itself, weighed down by the unimaginable weight of its own ego and given strength through the power of media. Yesterday I met with Prime Minister Greg Walden under two different pretences. He believed we were holding the first of our weekly meetings to finalise an election date - a vote that would once and for all resolve this political crisis. The truth is I held yesterday's meeting to gauge whether my Prime Minister could still honestly have my support and confidence as Cascadia's head of state. He could not. Despite what my mind saw as a potentially catastrophic manoeuvre, my heart told me to meet with Hilary Franz, leader of the parliamentary Labor Front. During this meeting we outlined a new plan for this nation and a resolution to the unfolding crisis in the capital. It was through both of these meetings that I came to a final conclusion this morning - one that I may never be able to run away from if I prove to misjudge the will of the Cascadian people.' Brown paused almost with a look of regret beginning to show. 'With immediate effect, the government of Greg Walden is hereby dissolved.

Through the creation of this pact, the Popular Front that led Cascadia to victory in the war for independence and officially governed the country until Hilary Franz' rise to power, has collapsed. Richardson's Conservatives, being the last remaining junior member of the Popular Front alongside Greg Walden, have expressed their disappointment with the former Prime Minister's lack of action and inability to control cabinet in preceding weeks, stating that only the Coalition for Freedom can restore security, stability and confidence. As of now it appears libertarian Wes Wagner is the unofficial leader of this unexpected alliance, and will become Prime Minister if the Libertarians and their colleagues can claim victory in next week's vote."

Opinion polls have varied wildly, with all major parties seemingly with equal potential to claim a clean victory, and there is no certainty at all amongst political commentators as to who will indeed come out on top. Perhaps the most unexpected outcome of Cascadia's first general election is the Coalition for Freedom's ruthlessness and ability to consistently knock back parliamentary candidates of the Independence Party and Labor Front. Several key seats have seen the coalition's numbers jump by double digits since the beginning of the campaign, signalling a potential victory for Wagner's unlikely alliance. In the end however, Prime Minister Franz could still have the advantage of incumbency, and Walden has been making great strides in rural Cascadia on a platform of being anti-establishment and in particular - anti-President Brown. Whoever comes out on top will surely make history and define Cascadia's economic, political and social vision for decades to come."

Libertarian Wes Wagner is currently the nation's interim head of government until leaders of the three parties can come to a final decision, one that will surely polarise many conservatives, progressives and centrists. The President declined to comment on the inner workings of the coalition, instead calling on her new government to 'act in the people's best interests and quickly elect a Prime Minister to serve his nation in the years to come'. Sources from within the presidential office have indicated Brown personally supports Stine, being the most ideologically similar to her beliefs and vision for Cascadia, but any explicit support for a candidate could lead to another potential constitutional crisis. Stine himself has responded to these rumours by stating he's 'glad to have the President's unwavering support'."

Amongst the many bills signed into law by the President were landmark documents that formally legalised same-sex marriage, abortion up to 18 weeks and euthanasia. These deeply controversial pieces of legislation have certainly divided the community and caused much uproar against the government, but with a comfortable majority in the legislature, there is no hope for the opposition in mounting an effective resistance against their passage. As politicians like Dennis Richardson and Greg Walden protest such left wing social policies, a bill has just been put forward to members of parliament by the Minister for Home Affairs that would solidify separation of church and state, and force all churches in Cascadia to pay their fair share of taxes. Certainly set to anger religious interest groups and the conservatives within parliament, this is just another law that will continue to define the progressive nature of Hilary Franz' forward-thinking government."

In the end, the party room came to the conclusion that this course of action would be beneficial not just to our prospects at the next parliamentary election, but for Cascadia's peace of mind. After a series of negotiations between the two parties, the Labor Front and Pacific Greens announced a formal coalition in parliament today. As part of the process, Franz promised her government would put environmental issues at the forefront of their agenda, and multiple cabinet positions would be filled by representatives of the junior coalition partner.

The Prime Minister initiated a plan not long ago to release prisoners that hadn't committed any war crimes against the Cascadian people, and declared it publicly. However, in the many weeks since, their relatives grew restless and demanded answers from the government, of which they received almost none - bar the tired bureaucratic responses. Growing into an unexpected movement against Hilary Franz, their fight quickly gained traction in the media, leading to several lawsuits and a heartbreaking plea from grandmother Mary Polmer that touched the hearts of millions. Finally, as cabinet began to pressure their head of government to act decisively and end negotiations once and for all, Franz announced today that conditions she had originally placed would be removed, and innocent prisoners of war would be released with immediate effect. The announcement drew cheers and tears from people that had gathered around large television screens in public places to observe Franz' declaration, but many still held deep anger towards her previous inaction. Minutes after the speech, President Brown signed a document handed to her by the Prime Minister, and the long saga of back and forth anger came to a bittersweet end."

Facing an uphill battle against members of her own party room, the Prime Minister sought to rid fears of increased taxes under this government and offer working class families a real chance to pull through in harsh economic times. Despite media reports of a caucus coup against the PM, Franz turned out to have the numbers against her detractors, proposing several bills on the floor of parliament just a few days ago. Today as they were officially signed into law by Cascadia's head of state, a woman that had publicly and perhaps in breach of her constitutional rights expressed opposition to reduced taxes, and the Labor Front's chances of being re-elected jumped astronomically. This new legislation will surely continue to anger dissident members of the Labor Front, and could in the end spell disaster for Hilary Franz in the next party leadership election.

In his address to parliament today, the Prime Minister expressed his desire to model upcoming legislation around 'Christian values' and the 'traditional ideals of Christ', drawing both hearty laughter and jeers from the opposition, as well as clearly bewildered looks from members of his own Coalition for Freedom. If Richardson follows through with his plans for traditionalist legislation on social issues like same-sex marriage, the further criminalisation of drugs and abortion, he could face an uphill battle against representatives of the Progressive Party, a fellow member of the parliamentary alliance. Setting these plans in motion could even trigger a collapse of the coalition, meaning PM Richardson must tread carefully through these waters. Already the office of the head of government is minimising the impact of today's speech, by outlining how Dennis Richardson simply intends to work with his coalition partners to draft meaningful social legislation in line with Christian values. Expert observers today told the 6.30 Roundtable that if the Progressive Party refuses to approve the legislation, it can easily be passed with the support of the Independence Party in parliament."

Whether the move is politically motivated or a genuine effort to bolster the nation's defences against a potential threat may never be known, but for now the government's approval has noticed a small spike - more than likely from veterans of the Cascadian war for independence.

Considered a defining achievement of this administration, the legislation just signed by Kate Brown establishes a system similar to that of Switzerland, whereby citizens are granted the powerful ability to essentially set the government's policy agenda. Over the course of the next few years and as the system is gradually refined, Cascadians will see countless referendums on issues they approve via petition. A new government website, 'wevote.gov', is reportedly in the works and shall serve the purpose of facilitating these petitions in an efficient, secure and stable process. Opposing the Prime Minister's brainchild this week were both the formerly ruling parties.

Earlier in the week a representative of the Libertarian Party moved the bill be debated, triggering an upset from fellow coalition representatives in the Progressive Party. In the days following, countless meetings were called by every party, and for most it was concluded that a conscience vote would be held when the time came. Nevertheless, the Progressive Party and many allies within the Independence Party and Labor Front formed a formidable opposition to the proposal. So strong was this backlash that it threatened to bring an end to the ruling Coalition for Freedom, and potentially another general election. Thanks to the help of prominent lobbyists and round-the-clock workings of party factions, the 'Cascadian Ammunitions and Weaponry Act' passed with only a four vote margin. Now the time has come for Prime Minister Wagner to pull his coalition together again and make a concession to Kevin Stine's Progressives."

The tax reform bill put forward to parliament almost two weeks ago would have in any other situation faced significant gridlock, but it seems Kevin Stine has accepted the reality of the ruling coalition and the consequences of continuing Wagner's paramount leadership into formal governance. Surprising virtually no political commentators, the reforms drastically cutting taxes for all income brackets went through the chamber amid minimal controversy, as it was approved by every single party. According to anonymous sources however, Stine is still deeply uncomfortable with allowing this legislation to pass, and is preparing to leave the Coalition for Freedom at the next general election. Whether this may be true is irrelevant now though, as the Progressives continue to stand strong with the Libertarian and Conservative parties, as long as their own policies are put forward in the future."

Drawing unrelenting opposition from representatives of the Labor Front and union leaders themselves, the meeting resulted in a walkout of many union delegates and triggered a public dispute in several minor leftist parties. According to a press release from the Prime Minister's office, Stine formally cut off the significant influence trade unions once held over the Progressive Party, and rescinded on multiple promises made during the general election campaign. In the future it seems unions will play a virtually non-existent role in shaping legislation, and could see their reach and membership greatly diminished. The surprise move from the famously working-class Prime Minister has shocked many of his own supporters, but also reeled in support from voters frustrated with the bureaucracy and corruption of trade unions. Whether this new 'vision' will see a net loss for the Progressives at Cascadia's next parliamentary election remains yet to be seen, but for now the Prime Minister is free to pursue his left wing agenda.

Kevin Stine's stirring speech in the chamber yesterday allowed the Prime Minister to express his vision for Cascadia in the 2020s, one of multiculturalism, unprecedented diversity and the 'basic love for fellow men, women and children'. A subsequent vote saw the bill pass with flying colours despite an attempted filibuster by Independence Party representative Dave Reichert later that day. Reichert faces a tough re-election battle as members of his own constituency react harshly to his actions in parliament, as well as two failed bids for the party leadership.

Clearly dividing the room before her, scientists and economists gathered to hear the President and left either in agreement or bewilderment. Today however it appears as though the government itself has totally turned around on its initial plan, with the Innovation Minister instead approving Kate Brown's initiative for consideration in parliament. While the Prime Minister himself has made no comment on the issue - in several press conferences and interviews he has diverted questions to the relevant minister - cabinet minutes released under the Public Information Law indicate he has felt belittled by Brown, but reluctantly supportive of her plan.

Some observers believe Kevin Stine felt belittled by Cascadia's head of state, and due to this fact outright refused to entertain the idea of approving her plan, resulting in today's announcement from the Innovation Minister.

Ever since claiming victory in the recent parliamentary election, the Prime Minister has been embarking on a spectacular nation-building exercise, seeking to rapidly expand not just Cascadia's military but her economic, political and geopolitical potential. As such a young nation, this conscription initiative is by far an excellent way to kick off the beginning of a new, prouder era in Cascadia's hopefully long history. Representatives of the Labor Front - Mr. Walden's staunchest opposition in parliament - were less than enthusiastic however, claiming that with the implementation of conscription 'our Prime Minister is giving rise to a generation comfortable with war and jingoism, simply without any knowledge of peace and stability'.

Despite rumours circulating that Walden would simply ignore the onslaught of vicious attacks, Cascadia's head of government retaliated with ferocity on the floor of parliament. Calling on all members of parliament to rise above the partisan rabble and support a series of pro-environment and anti-big business legislation his party is set to introduce next week, the Prime Minister was met with bewilderment. With increasing rhetoric and metaphor, the speech ended at a crescendo as Greg Walden decried those 'relentlessly obsessed with Cascadia's national security, but without care for her natural security', a jab potentially aimed at anti-environmentalists within his own party.

Leaders of the major opposition parties held a joint press conference just a few hours ago to accuse the government of 'preparing for an offensive war' and 'setting a plan in motion to violently expand Cascadia's borders'. The Prime Minister declined to respond to these comments, instead telling a late night host, 'These are the people making statements from the position of opposition. Perhaps they should consider why they are in opposition, and hence if the Cascadian people actually care in any way about what they're whining about'. Either way, defence industry representatives appear happy with today's developments, as either a defensive or offensive war would mean a greater boost to government funding and total profits in the long run."

Following this working lunch, our Foreign Affairs minister took his Northern counterparts on a hunting trip in the forests of Washington, drawing strong criticism from animal rights advocates, who labelled the trip as a 'disgraceful effort to bring back early 20th century methods of diplomacy'. The minister's office declined to comment and instead outlined a series of initiatives discussed by the delegation during the hunting endeavour, with one including a potential military alliance between Cascadia and Canada.

Directing interested parties to the ministry website 'minev.gov', the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources spoke to journalists outside her office and defined the controversial carbon tax as 'a tax on the use of fossil fuels intended to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide'. The legislation comes as a direct result of Hilary Franz' unexpected formation of a coalition with the Pacific Greens, a relatively minor party in parliament, but with growing popularity outside of it. Cascadia's populace continues to grow more aware of the environmental impact of their decisions, and the Greens appear to be latching on to this fact with unprecedented force. If Franz' administration can continue with similar laws and successfully pass them through parliament, Cascadia could easily become a global leader in tackling environmental damage."

The results of this survey provide a major confidence boost for Prime Minister Richardson's government as it enters another period of legislative troubles, struggling to push major reforms through a deeply divided parliament.

The legalisation and taxation of drugs such as cannabis and MDMA will according to the official government reports reap in hundreds of millions - potentially billions in the near future - for each state, and could see Cascadia finally become an economic powerhouse in the financially ruined former United States. Before the Prime Minister's speech before parliament however, the President of 'Cascadians Against Narcotics' - or CAN - declared she was prepared to forge an unstoppable coalition of politicians, businesses and 'community leaders' to repeal today's legislation."

For the past week supporters of the confederate plan worked around the clock to garner support within parliament, while their opponents fell further and further behind, and the effects were starting to show. Despite commentators previously laughing at the idea of a Cascadian Confederation - initially a campaign promise toyed with but ultimately dropped by Wes Wagner's Libertarians - the government has finally achieved its vision for Cascadia, one that would turn its political landscape on its head. Perhaps even an old rivalry came to an end, with President Kate Brown stepping down to not only likely recede into the political wilderness, but be replaced by Wes Wagner himself, a longtime opponent of the woman he deems responsible for Cascadia's political troubles. The handover came into effect mere minutes ago, and with the downfall of Brown and the failure of our new President's enemies to keep Cascadia a centralised republic, the nation enters uncharted territory..."

As terrified spectators ducked for cover, jumped onto the ground or ran for their lives, it took minutes for many to realise that Brown lay motionless on the stage before them. The President's secret service had already rushed by her side while their colleagues sought out the gunman, but by that point it appeared too late. Emergency services arrived with unprecedented speed to rush Kate Brown to the nearest hospital, just as cabinet convened in an emergency session to discuss their next course of action, one that could make a stunning mark on Cascadia's history in the years to come. With no clear line of succession to the ceremonial Presidency outlined in the constitution, Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] assumed the interim presidency until Brown's condition could be determined, drawing both support for a quick and effective response, and outrage for a supposed 'power grab'. Thankfully as the dust settled, a hospital spokesperson stepped outside to the onslaught of waiting cameramen and women and informed fellow Cascadians that their President was in a stable condition, but would not be out of the hospital for an indefinite amount of time. This time the President has come out bruised but alive, and the secret service has an astronomical amount of answering to do, as to why our head of state was so vulnerable to attack today."

Today those same investors formally registered Orecorp as a publicly listed company, and held a highly-anticipated press conference at their new headquarters in Portland where reporters fired off question after question, each answered with precision and honesty. As far as we can gather from the press conference, Orecorp will begin operations with a series of construction projects across Oregon, including but not limited to the new Portland Exhibition Centre, a high-end residential suburb in Salem, and Mt. Jefferson Subterranean Base, the last of which has garnered a laughable amount of conspiracy theories.

According to a news article published just last night, Orecorp is through these factories manufacturing a stunning range of products both for domestic and international consumers, including children's toys and state-of-the-art televisions. The article has surprised many in the business community as previously Orecorp has remained quite secretive about any of its operations, choosing to engage with media only when absolutely necessary.

Despite a series of setbacks for the Portland Exhibition Centre, Orecorp's many other construction projects have proceeded swimmingly and many times ahead of schedule, in particular the government-funded Mt.

During a time of great economic uncertainty stemming both from the war for independence and general international situation, the news comes as a great relief to not just the embattled government, but of course the Cascadian people for whom these jobs provide food on the table.

This night however, curiosity overwhelmed all other thoughts, bringing her to open the envelope with a swift brush of the tableside letter opener. Even with just a simple scan of the contents, she at that point realised in her hands was a letter that could easily shape her career, the nation and threaten to put her life in danger.

Journalists were expecting a full response from either the head of state or government, but no official press release was delivered by either other than a short statement from the Assistant Minister himself. His claims of resigning due to a need to spend more time with his family appear to have fallen on deaf ears, with rumours already circulating about the countless possible scenarios.

Many believe it comes as the result of a 'bitter feud' between Kevin Stine and Stencel, a theory that has continuously grown in scale in the past week, beginning to encompass other cabinet members who apparently 'wanted the Assistant Minister out of the picture'. On the other hand, an idea that has persisted since long before Stencel's removal, is that the defence industry and the Prime Minister's office continue to wrestle for control over Cascadia. Commentators on the 6.30 Roundtable last night speculated amongst themselves and accepted audience submissions, but in the end there was no clear consensus reached in regards to why the Prime Minister would feel the need to fire his Assistant Defence Minister in such a stable climate."

With seemingly no relation between these two decisions, the public are left to wonder what is going on within the Stine administration, and whether there could be a possible link that the Prime Minister is keeping hidden. In his weekly press conference this morning the head of this polarising government explained a tip off had been received concerning the activities of Orecorp, and that an official inquiry was necessary to access the validity of this tip off. Cascadian executives slammed Stine's press conference, expressing in various television interviews their dismay that a simple tip off could trigger a full attack against Oregon's largest corporation. The Morning Show's finance reporter Chris Ingalls added to the nationwide debate by asking Prime Minister Stine, 'What would happen if every supposed tip off, every criticism and every letter from a disgruntled employee triggered an operation-halting inquiry? I can tell you Mr. Prime Minister, because it seems I and the rest of the nation have more economics expertise than the man who's supposed to be leading us. Cascadia would go belly up, and with all these companies being investigated, audited, you name it, millions would be out of a job. So I'll reiterate what I said earlier, how genuine really is this tip-off, and is this not just the result of a Prime Minister's temper tantrum when he doesn't get the answer he wants from the Orecorp board?'"

During a previously scheduled and unrelated speech at the Olympia Human Rights Conference, Brown announced that through a series of discussions with Prime Minister Stine and stakeholders in the business community, she had concluded that it was in the best interests of Cascadia's 'economic and national security' to begin an investigation. Drawing a mixed response from the crowd, the announcement has sent further shockwaves reaching all the way to Canada, where Orecorp's board is in damage control, as it is forced to face unexpected media attention for which it is deeply unprepared.

Former employees of the Canadian company came forward today to make a string of allegations, including supposed wage theft, mistreatment by managers in Orecorp's many factories, and tax evasion. Their testimonies have triggered an emergency meeting of investors in the dead of night, where those with keen interests in keeping the company afloat discussed possible routes to take. It seems for now Orecorp has concluded it would be best to weather the storm, and attack witnesses for coming forward without any evidence."

Of those who have already testified against the corporation, none have provided any proof of the allegations made during the Commission's hearings, and instead been attacked viciously not just by their former employer but Cascadia's ruthless media cycle. Other than the families and friends of witnesses, there has been little backlash against this move from the Commissioner, as many Cascadians see the inquiry itself as a blatant sham orchestrated by the Prime Minister. Stine's previous attacks against big business and frequent clashes with coalition colleagues over the issue have perhaps damaged the community's perspective of their PM, at least on matters relating to business and finance."

Late night hosts however have turned the situation into a laughing stock, with humorous representations of Witness F belittling her turnaround, as she had once rejected any notions of working with the Commission. In a more professional tone, Orecorp's board of investors released a statement expressing their support for Witness F, but once again promised that the company had no record of wrongdoing in Oregon, and that her testimony would 'absolutely be refuted if it is likely found to be a farce'. The Commission's final highly-anticipated testimony is scheduled for two days from now at the Temple of Justice in Olympia, and will be the first nationally televised hearing of the inquiry."

However, as the minutes ticked by and the expected arrival time of Witness F became ten, twenty, thirty minutes, an hour ago, many felt that something was wrong. That night as the Commissioner sat confused, their witness never testified. In the hours following, media personalities and politicians attempted to dissect the events that had occurred prior, and if the announcement of the Commission hadn't divided a nation, today certainly has. On the one hand, many became concerned that Witness F has been abducted or worse by those close to the heart of Orecorp, perhaps giving truth to the many conspiracy theories surrounding their activities in Oregon. And yet on the other, the majority view appears to be that today's witness was simply a woman out to seek attention, but backed down at the last minute after seeing and hearing the relentless negative press - and laughing stock she had become. Whatever the case, it will now be up to the Commissioner to decide on his next course of action."

At 2 AM this morning, Stine received word that all operations had ultimately been successful, and hundreds and hundreds of evidence had been retrieved from the headquarters of Orecorp. The lesser known operation against Stine's former colleague Michael Stencel resulted in the latter's horrific suicide in the serene garden of his own home, but also the extraction of a series of confidential documents and the minister's potentially compromising electronic devices."

According to a preliminary report released by the Commissioner this morning, Orecorp's construction projects at Mt. Jefferson and the capital were intentionally sabotaged to prepare for a horrifying attack against members of government in the near future. If the plan were to have been carried out, Prime Minister Stine, President Brown and other members of government would have been forced to evacuate the capital and directed to the recently constructed subterranean base at Mt. Jefferson. Once sealed, the base would have destroyed by an alarmingly large network of explosive devices placed throughout the facility. If successful, the plan would have seen Assistant Defence Minister Stencel in line for the Prime Ministership, and an interim Presidency established through a small group of military officials serving as a collective head of state. With thousands more pages of confidential documents to file through, these revelations are surely just the beginning. All Orecorp executives have declined to comment, and some are reportedly preparing to flee Canada in search of a safe haven."

Some of the most significant unanswered questions remaining are 'what happened to Witness F?', and 'how large a role did the media play in protecting Orecorp from the government?'. The latter triggered an apology from Chris Ingalls as he spoke over vision of Orecorp's Vice President being whisked away by police, in which he declared he was personally responsible for the public's dismissal of Kevin Stine's inquiry.

Countless factories, shipyards, and many other projects will soon be under the control of either the state government or other closely-linked businesses. Prime Minister Stine delivered his first speech to parliament since those stunning revelations not long ago, in which it was revealed Orecorp planned to overthrow the Cascadian government and replace it with a corporate-friendly military junta.

Factories and dockyards once constructed and operated by the disgraced Canadian megacorporation lie abandoned across the landscape of Oregon, with the jobs lost in the process failing to materialise again. Private companies who eventually took control of these assets have failed to keep them running in recent months and instead chosen to lay off most employees, leaving a great hole in the state economy, and thousands upon thousands out of employment indefinitely. Urban explorers now regularly post videos online of their 'expeditions' into derelict sites, resulting just last week in a horrifying death for one of the internet's most well known 'Urbex' figures.

Now however, her job is clearly on the line. Opposition groups announced weeks ago that famous revolutionary Ted Wheeler would be nominated as their desired candidate, forming a united front against the politically and financially powerful Burdick. Whether the left wing Wheeler can pull off a historic victory against one of the last remnants of Communism in Cascadia however is uncertain, as rival candidates from the disgruntled right wing received an astonishing amount of campaign donations in recent months. The election was expected to be a test for the Coalition for Freedom, as leaders of the Conservative, Libertarian and Progressive parties each clearly have a preferred candidate in the race.

Recalling his time as the leader of Cascadia's pro-democracy revolution in Portland, and a prominent organiser of the resistance during its war for independence, he expressed his desire for a city that could move past its history and 'embrace an entirely new vision'. Wheeler lambasted the bureaucratic and derelict government of Ginny Burdick, and condemned other local governments in the same manner, calling on fellow Cascadians to 'overturn a political system that has remained entrenched since the fall of socialism'. Many have heeded his call, and are preparing for historic upsets across the nation at the lowest levels of government, but where politics is unexpectedly the most impactful on our lives.

The confession also resulted in the arrests of multiple other KKK members, being ratted out by their fellow Klansman, another spectacular victory for police in their ongoing investigation against white supremacist organisations.

With some of the arrests televised live, millions tuned in tonight to watch as the disgraced Klan members were hauled into police cars on their way to local stations. County Commissioner Tabb announced that after extensive consultation with law enforcement and residents in Easton, the accused will be transported to Olympia for their trial, for the sole purpose of making a highly publicised example out of them. As there is believed to be enough evidence to warrant harsh sentencing for most of the Klansmen, many could be seeing life behind bars for their involvement in hateful activities across rural Washington. [Root.GetLeader] generously offered to pay for the transportation of Easton's black citizens, and for the mother shockingly beaten in her own home, an offer to dine at the Prime Minister's residence with her family.

Accused of attempted murder, theft, terrorism and a wide range of hate crimes, the Klansmen have faced a relentless onslaught of media attention, especially as they arrived at Olympia's recently constructed Central Station. Journalists rushed to catch a glimpse of those potentially facing life sentences, but all the cameras could catch was a flurry of security guards and police escorting the cuffed individuals into a motorcade of cars. The situation has grown so intense that there are even reports of hundreds already flying, driving or taking the train to Olympia to be amongst the action. At this point, some officials within the police department are concerned about the possibility of an assassination, as the general public's vicious hatred of the accused Klansman comes out in full swing. Olympia's Chief of Police encouraged the people of Cascadia to 'not do anything stupid' and 'stop yourselves from acting on the hatred I know you must be feeling at this time'."

The guilty verdict was met with the juxtaposition of cheers and tears from those observing the trial, as countless emotions surely flowed over them. Many had been directly affected by the actions of the white supremacist organisation, which had only been discovered through evidence uncovered in court, and painted a horrifying picture of systematic attacks against black residents in communities across rural Washington. From Easton to as far away as Orondo, the network 'raped and pillaged in the most barbaric manner' as said by the judge when she bestowed today's historic sentences on the vile beings before her. One of the accused wept as he heard he would be facing eight years in a state prison, but his fellow Klansmen appeared eerily stoic in the face of such a miserable future. After all, they have lived by and more than likely will continue to live by the phrase 'stand up and be counted'."

The televised trial of Ku Klux Klan members in Olympia united a nation increasingly divided along political and social lines, bringing people together to watch as the presiding judge handed down sentence after sentence. With the process officially over, the street celebrations have even garnered international attention for the past week of developments and triggered a nationwide debate on racism, hate and polarisation. An increasingly popular and relevant Olympia Late Night drew millions to tune in with the Prime Minister, opposition leaders and experts from multiple fields all at a table to discuss what Cascadia can do to combat this kind of hate to the fullest extent. Despite differences in policy ideas and conviction, all agreed that what occurred in Easton and throughout the small towns of Kittitas County must never be allowed to occur again. [Root.GetLeader] would certainly hope so, as while this week has seen a massive popularity boost for the ruling party, another similar event would likely have the opposite effect."

At first, Prime Minister Stine was willing to ignore the possible dangers, too busy scrambling to put government affairs back in order and start an investigation into the assassination attempt. However, the “seismic” activity only continued to increase. The hastily-built bunkers began to show cracks, and before they were able to act, the mountain was lit ablaze in an explosion the size of the Halifax one in 1917, burying the Executive branch in the rubble. Dozens of staffers were killed in this sabotage, including Kate Brown and Kevin Stine. The government was forced to call upon the military to assist with the recovery operation. News media quickly picked up on this most distressing situation, and with many suspecting OreCorp’s role in the creation of the complex a huge red flag.

Addressing the captive lawmakers, Stencel declared the failure of Stine’s government and the numerous crimes it had committed against the people of Cascadia, and that their downfall at Mount Jefferson was a tragic but deserved fate. It was up to the military to restore the basic freedoms of the state and defend the legacy of those who died fighting for independence. Until further notice, Seattle would be under a strict curfew.

Promising to bring about a new age of corporatocracy for the nation, the demands have been largely supported by members of Stencel’s cabinet who believe that the Marshal’s leadership was merely a transitional period until the rebellion had been crushed. However, others have demanded that Stencel reject their corporation's demands, believing that an Orecorp takeover of Cascadia would lead to nothing but ruin for the young state.

Notable differences between our world and McMillan's carefully crafted scenario include the Soviet dissolution into its constituent republics and even smaller autonomous SSRs, the fall of Communist China and an Africa dominated by borderline fascistic right-wing despots.

In the past McMillan has restricted his novels to single locations, preferring storylines localised in eerie cabins or isolated palaces, but Rising Eagle takes readers on new adventures throughout a Spain still devastated by ethnic war, the corrupt and tyrannical South American Union, and various horrifying warlord territories in the deepest jungles of Africa. Despite this critical acclaim however, negative reviews for the novel also come from renowned critics on both sides of the Atlantic. The Authors Think Tank of Boston released a preliminary report on McMillan's latest work, blasting the Irish writer for 'gross exaggeration of capitalist success' and his 'belief that in any world Vietnam would be won by the South, let alone an imperial restoration in the reunified nation'. Less politically motivated critics instead suggested that the narrative itself consisted of countless plot holes, in particular when Curren reveals the true assassin of President Baldwin, but never how he obtained this information."

A funeral is expected to be held in his Texas hometown, and Mark Milley himself has already expressed his sadness at the King's passing, pledging that he would be at the funeral to pay his respects to the old King. Surprisingly enough, Milley has not taken control of the nation again, but has instead left it to the Council of Princes, who will serve as the nation's governing body until a new King is decided.\n\nAll eyes are on Crown Prince Richard Washington, but news of Paul's heir has always been extremely secretive, and many suggest that Richard has no interest in the throne. Bill Washington, Paul's second son and staunch monarchist and revolutionary historian, has expressed his willingness to suceed his father in place of Richard, but as neither of them hold much influence in the Council of Princes, it seems it will be up to them to decide."

However, to the rest of the government of America, it has come as a shock. America's political leaders, chief among them Mark Milley and former Bush-supporting politicians, have declared that Richard must take his place as King of America in accordance with the line of succession, but many suggest they have an ulterior motive of keeping the Democrat-supporting Bill Washington as far away from power as possible.\n\nThe matter of succession has been left up to the Council of Princes as the supreme legislative body of the Union of American Kingdoms, and all eyes are on them to see how they will take Richard Washington's refusal to take his place as the rightful King of the American people."

Although he has had no public experience in politics since the widespread support for the Washington Cult first began, Hamilton remains a darling of monarchists across the nation, and has been endorsed by Catholic monarchist Charles A. Coulombe.\n\nAnother choice comes from Paul Washington's second son, William Washington. A Texan with a deep interest in the American revolution and a populist political slant that saw him support the Democratic Party in opposition to his father, William "Bill" Washington is a passionate supporter of what America should and will always represent.\n\nRobert E. Lee V is the heir of both Washington's adopted son and the Lees of Virginia, a prominent aristocratic family from the South which has produced some of the most well-known men of Dixie to date. Lee's blue blood and Southern spirit have made him a popular choice, but the Prince of the House of Lee has not exactly been active much in politics.\n\nThe fourth choice, Lucian K.

President Essam Sharaf has refused to issue an official declaration of war, stating that Syria is not a legitimate state but rather a rebellious province of the UAR. Still, the Egyptian military has been mobilized in what can only be described as a preparation for all out war, with Sharaf’s traditional rivals in the military clique staunchly supporting the president’s call to restore order in Syria. Only time will tell if the UAR is capable of subduing the rebellion or if Assad will successfully lead Syria towards independence."

While internal conflicts and divisions have plagued the nation since its inception, the past few months have seen Syrian nationalism become a particularly prominent issue after Bashar Al-Assad was elected regional president of Syria. Now the republic seems to be at the end of its life as Syria has declared its independence from the UAR and denounced it as a failed state. Syria's desire for independence has been growing within the region for a while, with many Syrians believing that the UAR’s main interests have always been to strengthen Cairo rather than Damascus. Despite calls from Sharaf’s traditional rivals in the military clique, the president refused to authorize any military action against the rebellious province. This apparent cowardice was widely condemned in Egypt and shortly thereafter Sharaf’s government was overthrown by Omar Suleiman, head of the General Intelligence Directorate. Suleiman then put the last nail in the coffin of the pan-Arab cause by officially dissolving the UAR."

As the speech continued, the crowd let out a thunderous cheer as Davis promised to liberate the women of America from the patriarchy that had been enshrined into American culture. With Davis’ accomplishment, her new America has already received praise from the various communist nations of the world, but has been shunned by the Democratic League. Davis’ closing statements marked the start of widespread change for America, with her promising to bring communism to each coast of America, no matter how long it may take. With Davis’ emphasis on women and ethnic minorities, quality of life will soon improve for these groups, as her administration is eager to continue the policies enacted after her successful re-election during the 30th Party Congress.

General Secretary Tyner has already promised to continue the reforms he had started upon his election, with many in America seeing this as the dawn of a new age and the beginning of the liberalization of UAPR. The Warsaw Pact has already given their congratulations to Tyner and his Union, yet Canada and the Democratic League are more apprehensive of this supposed communist liberalizer, wondering whether Tyner will follow through with his plans.

In order to appease the public, President Sharaf was forced to concede to their demands and reach out to the Syrian government asking for an end to the war. Seizing the opportunity to finally achieve their independence, they agreed and soon ceasefire talks were underway. Now after days of negotiations, the ceasefire has been signed concluding the Egyptian-Syrian war.

With full control over the nation, Webb has begun to break free from the isolationist policies of his predecessor and reach out to other communist governments of the world as a sign of friendship. As Webb consolidates his control over the continental US, integrating the many breakaway nations into the economic and social fabric of the Union, it seems that the ideals of communism have triumphed once again, this time in America."

As the international community watches the successor complete his economic reform, most have already begun to embargo the nation and withdraw their ambassadors in retaliation against the state and its actions. With Sander’s dream being continued in all but economic policy, the surrounding neighbours of the regime have begun the militarisation of their borders as plans for a potential invasion of Canada and Mexico have been reported to be in the works by Gerard’s loyal military strategists.

However, this decision was suddenly obstructed by one of the Council’s leading figures, Douglas Hamilton, the descendant of Alexander Hamilton. He stated that the monarchy must adapt and that instead of “succumbing to the very ideals that America fought against” it should evolve and keep to a plan supposedly devised by his ancestor. The plan dictates an elective monarchy, where the Council of Princes will decide who will be the successor of Paul.

Running against the incumbent leader is Tim Farron, a relatively new member of the party, who has spent his career advocating for a more liberal Britain focusing on a revitalized economy that would prioritize the environment, easier access for migrants to Britain from across the free world and the legalization of marijuana. Farron has described himself as a centre-left candidate, with many hoping this will once again translate to a loss for the Labour and Independent Labour Party. Alongside Farron, Sarah Olney has also gained traction within the Liberal Democrat Party. Similar to Farron, Olney has been an outspoken supporter of a green Britain believing that the nation must revitalize its economy to focus on the preservation of both the environment and the wellbeing of the planet. Unlike other members of her party, Olney has also been an advocate for Britain to expand trade across the globe and secure healthier relations with Britain’s European neighbours. However, despite their failure at the general election, some believe that the party's leader should remain and succeed in 2017."

Alongside Swinson, Luciana Berger has also gathered much support from within the party. As a woman of Jewish heritage, Berger has clung to this identity throughout her time as a Liberal Democrat member strongly following the Jewish teachings of “Tikkun Olam”. It is this desire to “repair the world” that has placed her at the forefront of the election, with many seeing her as the ideal candidate to counter the growing tensions across the world and heal the political divides within Britain.

Whilst his comments have seen widespread support, some have begun to speculate about McDonnell’s statement, believing that McDonnell harbours opposition towards Galloway’s course, and that his comments referred to the now jailed Jeremy Corbyn, his old friend. However, the Chairman has dismissed these rumours as nothing more than an attempt by McDonnell’s opponents to disrupt the fragile alliance of parties.

Arguing that by focusing on internal reform, such as devolution for the Scottish and Welsh peoples, and furthering relations with like-minded governments such as the American People’s Commonwealth, Britain can establish itself as a world power once more. While some within the party, most notably the Chairman himself, are sceptical of the domestic proposals, German’s stance on a potential alliance with the People’s Commonwealth has been received with high praise, with great advantages for both states being recognized.

With their ban on participation in politics now lifted, some members of the former Independent Labour Party have now willingly joined the WRP, with many speculating Jeremy Corbyn will eventually do the same.

Despite Griffiths’ and his allies’ fierce attempts to shut down the motion, they could not overturn the strong majority that had formed against them in the party.

In his place, the dedicated Hardliner Zane Carpenter has been sworn in as the new General Secretary of the Communist Party and now, with his outright majority within the Politburo and Central Committee, is free to further his own revolution; the total revolution.

In response to these findings, the General Secretary promptly initiated a purge against these two groups. What started out as a normal meeting of the Politburo quickly descended into chaos when the General Secretary denounced the Maoists as traitors to the revolution and the Hardliners as “Neo-Brezhnevites”, before soon after calling in operatives of MI5 to arrest the members of both factions.

This is highly irregular, and many within the cabinet are wondering whether the NRF are receiving foreign funding, or whether something else is going on."

 britain.284.d:0 "A new lead has been found in our investigation. MI5 has uncovered evidence of collusion between the National Revolutionary Front and the communists. One operative sighted the presence of a wanted fugitive, Seumas Milne, during a meeting of the national executive committee of the National Revolutionary Front. Milne avoided arrest during the initial crackdown, thanks to the insignificance of his tiny Maoist party. Although it’s currently unclear whether this act of collaboration is just Milne aiding the NRF or if it extends throughout the organisation, it is clear-cut evidence that the growth of the NRF is directly related to the presence of Communist terrorists. As such, some within the cabinet are calling for a direct crack-down now, in the hopes of catching Milne before he or anyone in the NRF leadership can figure out what is happening and escape, although the MI5 recommendation calls for further investigation to reveal just how deep this collaboration goes."

Both law enforcement and paramilitary organisations were mobilised to detain their leadership with all due haste, in the hopes of catching both them and Seumas Milne before any of them could manage to evade capture. As with the previous crackdown, it was a mixed success, as Patrick Harrington and multiple other NRF figures did not expect for their duplicity to be discovered, and yet Milne once more managed to evade capture. Moreover, news appears to have spread fast throughout the organisation of the crackdown, causing many members to go underground. Despite our apparent luck in detaining the upper echelons, our hasty intervention may have caused us to drive many of the non-Communist members of the NRF directly into the arms of Seumas Milne. Now, we can only expect for Communist subversion to increase."

This is already apparent, with their attacks against our loyal security forces and paramilitary organisations costing us more dearly now than before.

However, the President’s statements quickly backfired as several generals revealed that it was instead Saleh who had demanded the government consider the historical importance of the Sa’ada province and how this would affect the morale of the Houthi militia. Now with parliament descending into chaos as members of the General People’s Congress have denounced our government as liars and traitors, the people have taken to the streets in support of Saleh demanding the resignation of the President and his government."

Our government has maintained long-existing ties between our Islamic nations, and this declaration is widely seen as a show of Saudi support for our regime. However, behind closed doors, the ambassador and several officials have expressed their concerns about the current situation. After reassuring our Arab allies that further Saudi support will greatly boost the efforts of our government to stabilize the nation. After a ceremonial chewing of khat, a grand feast was organised for our Saudi friends to ensure their visit ended on a positive note.

Having been led on a tour by the manager, the minister enjoyed several meetings with dockyard workers, where he praised their hard work in rebuilding the port ensuring trade could flow between Yemen and its allies. Despite any political grievances these workers held with our government, the meeting with the workers remained cordial with handshakes and smiles being seen from all as camera crews took photos of Talib with these hard-working men. Having met with the workers, camera crews followed the minister to his meeting with Saudi and American investors, who have remained interested in further development of the harbor to ensure a constant flow of oil and natural gas. After several hours of negotiations, the meeting succeeded, securing many lucrative deals in the process. Satisfied, Talib stepped back in his armoured escort car, ready to return to Sana’a after a long and busy day."

However, reports have now come in that the minister did not reach the airport after his driver took an unfortunate wrong turn where the two became trapped in an ongoing Popular Revolution demonstration. With their car being rocked side-to-side as protestors recognized the minister inside, the situation soon became life-threatening for the minister and his driver. As his driver forced open his door pulling out his sidearm, an explosion immediately ripped through the crowd as a bomb was detonated that had been attached to the minister of finance's car. As the smoke of the burning car wreck rose into the Aden sky, emergency services rushed towards the site, finding the body of Saadaldeen Talib slumped over lifelessly on top of his car, surrounded by his security detail and over fifty protestors. With over seventy-five now reported dead and a further thirty-seven wounded, this attack has been announced as the worst in recent history with many eyes now looking towards the Yemeni Socialist Party as the likely actors behind this attack."

With protestors clashing with riot police in Aden, Sana’a, Taizz and event traditional Al-Islah strongholds such as Al-Hadaydah, the President has enforced martial law across the most rebellious cities attempting to ensure that the investigation into the minister of finance's death can be carried out swiftly and efficiently. Whilst the immediate situation has been stabilized by riot police and the military, protests have continued day and night across the country.

With the National Coalition and Yemeni National Front banding together all representatives were quickly banned from parliament after the speaker had denounced them for violating the constitution. With all representatives of the Jasmine Council banned from holding political office, the movement has now met with the leader of the Popular Revolution, Tawakkol Karman, to discuss her movement's integration into the Jasmine Council. A new force has now been established in Yemen as this pro-democracy movement begins to gain traction across the country with its leaders, Khaled Bahah, Najeeb al-Sha’abi and Tawakkol Karman representing a new era for Yemen. However, with the police continuing to suppress the movement’s demonstrations, it remains to be seen whether the band of democrats will be able to bring about any change to the nation."

The immediate response by many had been to blame the Yemeni Socialist Party, with their motive being to destabilize our government and bring about the southern uprising they have claimed would arrive since 2006. However, after months of investigation, the National Security Bureau has now cleared the YSP of all involvement in the Aden terrorist attack. Instead, to our shock and horror, the intelligence agency concluded that the attack was most likely carried out by a small cell of Islamic extremists that were bent on causing mass panic amongst the population in an effort to bring the Salafist movement to power. While Sheikh al-Zindani denies any involvement in the attack, the perpetrators were revealed to have graduated from the Al-Imam university, the university Zindani himself established.

Following an increase in attacks on military convoys near the Omani border, the survivors of this attack have now detailed that the town of Al-Ghaydah has fallen into the hands of the Yemeni Socialist Party. Having begun a multidirectional attack in the early hours of the morning, using captured tanks and other equipment, the city was cut off entirely from the rest of the country. With supply being cut off and all communications cut off soon thereafter, the local garrison was left to fend for itself against the communist partisans. After nearly an entire day of fighting, the YSP was able to capture the city centre encircling the main command outpost. In a last ditch effort, the commander stationed in Al-Ghaydah ordered an immediate retreat through either sea or land. However, only one hundred managed to escape the city and its supplies soon after fell into the hands of the YSP. Now with the former flag of the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen being flown above the city, the road to al-Mukkalla is wide open and it seems the YSP will use this to their advantage..."

Furthermore, worrying reports that several tribes across Yemen have also begun to shift their allegiance believing that our government no longer represents their best interests. In an attempt to reassure the tribes, Sadiq al-Ahmar, head of the Hashid Tribal Confederation, has been tasked with ensuring the continued loyalty of various tribes across Yemen. Following meetings with the various tribes across the north, al-Ahmar has reported that the negotiations with the tribes were less than successful. Despite having promised many tribes increased political representation, many have outright rejected al-Ahmar’s promises believing that the time of Al-Islah is coming to an end and that only through allying themselves with the General People’s Congress will the tribes of Yemen gain true political representation. Already reports of tribal funding to the General People’s Congress have been heard within parliament, leading many to believe that the decades long alliance between Al-Islah and the tribes is at last coming to an end."

One such solution presented to the President was the complete evacuation of all armed forces from the south in an effort to ensure political stability in the north. Having realized that maintaining control over the south would be a losing battle for the armed forces, the President has now authorized this evacuation leading to the further destabilization of the south. Cities along the Omani border have now been captured by members of the Yemeni Socialist Party with even al-Mukkalla falling to the communist partisans. Having been sighted for the first time in four years, leader of the YSP Ali Salem al Beidh stood before an overjoyed crowd that welcomed the return of communist rule to much of the south. Whilst the withdrawal order was heard by all members of the military, some have refused to cooperate, with many stationed in Aden refusing to return pledging their support for the Jasmine Council. With this uprising and mass defection by our armed forces, the government has now realized that Yemen has descended towards civil war."

Despite the best efforts of the armed convoy escorting it, the YSP forces managed to escape from Aden carrying approximately sixty-four billion Yemeni rials, equal to about one-hundred and seventy million US dollars. The rebels were able to elude military personnel loyal to the Jasmines, only leaving behind a partial sum of the money. With the success of this raid, our central bank has warned that without the inflow of these funds, it will become harder to maintain any semblance of economic stability, risking further financial ruin. Regardless, this has only further served to complicate and accelerate the rapidly deteriorating situation we are in, as we are facing complete and utter collapse."

Furthermore, the General People’s Congress’ elected officials have also disappeared with parliament being filled with members of Al-Islah. Now the reason behind these desertions has been revealed. In a televised address to the nation Ahmed Saleh, flanked by both Abdulmalik Al-Mekhlafi of the banned Nasserist Unionist People’s Organization and Abdel Malek al-Houthi of the Houthi movement, publicly announced the formation of a ‘Government of National Unity’, declaring the continued rule of Al-Islah to be illegitimate. To make matters worse, Saleh announced that he had been handed classified information from the National Security Bureau and revealed that Salafists were behind the Aden attack rather than the Yemeni Socialist Party. Saleh concluded by demanding the immediate resignation of our cabinet and for fresh elections to be held, stating that if his demands were not met he would march on Sana’a in a day and enforce his demands."

After extending his deadline by two days, Saleh’s advance has now begun with reports reaching the President that the Yemeni army has engaged the Republican Guard in conflict. The report has left the President at a loss for words, with his cabinet demanding to know what he will do to ensure our victory in this conflict. However, the President has refused to comment believing that the forces stationed in the region will be more than sufficient to push back the Republican Guard. Military generals on the ground have demanded the authorized use of aerial bombardment on Saleh’s position, hopefully killing the traitor and forcing his armies to retreat, but no such authorization has been given by the President who has now fled Sana’a in fear of Saleh’s victory. The situation is dire, and many believe that the outcome of this conflict will set in stone the front lines for the upcoming fight against Saleh and any more who wish to see our government overthrown."

For the second time in recent history, our nation has been torn apart and the government can do nothing but watch on in abject horror that the supposed peace brought about in 2004 was nothing more than the prelude to further conflict.

Now the die has been cast once more as Yemen has descended into an all-out civil war. The democratic Jasmine movement that has been demanding constitutional reform for a completely open democratic system has concentrated on the urban cities of Aden and Taiz, while the Hadhramaut region has been completely overtaken by forces loyal to the former People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. Even the government itself has split between forces loyal to the Islamist Al-Islah party and those to the official opposition in parliament the General People’s Congress, led by the charismatic Ahmed Saleh. The situation grows increasingly more complex as various conflicting groups back their preferred side in a bid to power, all while the battle over control of the capital of Sana’a rages intensely.

Tawakkol Karman of the liberal Popular Revolution party spoke of the need for the Yemeni people to live in a free, fair and democratic system, with a particular emphasis on personal liberty and economic rejuvenation. Following her speech, Khaled Bahah of the centre aligned National Coalition spoke of the need for national healing, unity and stability, and the need for every Yemeni to feel like their voice is being heard.

Having cited this as a necessary measure to protect the army against insidious elements within its ranks with sympathies towards Saleh and the Al-Islah government, inspections across all divisions will now take place ensuring that all within our nation's military uphold the values of the new government; equality, liberty and democracy. With the removal of these insidious elements soon to be carried out, leading generals have already reported that the removal of these extremists shall further the morale of the army with every soldier becoming aware that each of their fellow soldiers fights to uphold the same values as them and that the new Yemen is no home for extremists."

Across the nation this announcement has been marked with significant approval as millions celebrate the end of tyranny, the return of democracy and the beginning of a new era for all Yemeni citizens.

Najeeb Sha’abi, of the Yemeni National Front, has run on a platform of allying with the socialists within the South to usher in a wave of reforms for the working class. Tawakkol Karman, of the Popular Revolution, instead believes that for Yemen to truly progress it must tackle the social issues left behind by the Al-Islah government, such as press restrictions and women's rights. Finally, Khaled Bahah, of the National Coalition, believes that Yemen will only prosper if it reaches a broad coalition across the nation and enacts a centrist economic policy.

Unexpectedly, the nation has managed to break free of its authoritarian nature and secured the democratic state it had fought for. Now our administration has received a message from the Yemeni ambassador to Canada, revealing that the small state wishes to join the ranks of the Democratic League. Whilst a young state, Yemen does qualify for entrance into our alliance. Accepting their request would strengthen our hold on the Middle East, allowing for unfettered access to the Red Sea and perhaps better deals on the Yemeni oil reserves. However, whilst Yemen does qualify to join our alliance perhaps it would be best to leave the status quo intact in the Middle East. With all the chaos that has engulfed the region, further instability would most likely be created with Yemen’s entry, perhaps even bringing us into wars with Saudi Arabia who have been attempting to exert influence over Yemen for decades."

Already, Canadian advisors have been sent to our nation to oversee the training of our army in an effort to bring it up to the same standards of the other members of the Democratic League. With Canadian acceptance, the free world has been given a much needed strategic location along the Red Sea as well as access to one of the world's leading producers of oil which will be able to fuel the upcoming war effort. Now as the President heads to Ottawa to continue to discuss Yemeni involvement in the Democratic League, the Warsaw Pact has begun to feel the pressure as the Middle East slowly begins to fall to the forces of democracy."

Whilst satisfied with our abilities to purge the last remaining vestiges of corruption and authoritarianism from our government, the Canadian government has raised concerns over the possibility of the conflicts that would arise should we join the Democratic League. Even though our positioning in the Middle East would grant the Democratic League easier access to the Red Sea, and access to much needed oil for the upcoming conflict, the Canadian government remains afraid of destabilizing the Middle East believing that our entry could incite tensions with Saudi Arabia. Whilst our diplomats attempted to ease the Canadian concerns, stating that the Saudi government had not attempted to impede on our sovereignty or politics since the fall of the Al-Islah government, these attempts fell on deaf ears with the Canadians eager to ensure the status quo in the Middle East. This refusal has lost the Democratic League not only a strategic ally in our region, but the respect of our people and our own government."

The alliance itself, named the Alliance of Arab States, would aim to hinder, and remove, the influence of the Democratic League and Warsaw Pact from within our borders to protect the Middle East from subversive actions by either of the two leading global alliances. Should we accept to join such an alliance, Yemen has announced that eventually the alliance would work towards the integration of our militaries under a single unified command structure, as well as focusing on a strong economic partnership. However, it has been revealed to us that the main purpose of such an alliance would be to contain the despotic regimes in our region and work to overthrow them, installing democratic governments in their place. Whilst some agree with this proposition, citing the benefits it would bring to the Middle East, there are those who oppose such a plan. Many critics of the proposal have stated that such an alliance would impede upon our national sovereignty granting those in Aden complete control over the foreign policy of our nation."

This rejection has placed a significant hindrance in our plans at liberating the Middle East, with the army of [From.GetName] being vital to our endeavours in this liberation.

Others, however, have called for these subsidies to be used to improve our farms so that they may instead prioritise the self-sufficiency of our nation.

It will be the voice of the Yemeni people itself that will directly decide the further course of this great nation.

Clearly, I was sorely mistaken.

Having briefly worked at the UN in Geneva in a committee surrounding the question, Karman is now at a convention of the Popular Revolution party, talking extensively about her decision for relaxing visa requirements: “What was the purpose of our Revolution? In my eyes it was to uphold peoples’ rights to elect their leaders and hold them accountable. To involve the people in the political process as equal citizens, who have rights and duties, embedded in our constitution. To build bridges and coalitions between different countries, cultures, religions, sects, gender, and ethnicities. That is what we fought for, and we must ensure that no other nation or people has to suffer because of their government’s leadership. Therefore, today I open the borders of Yemen to all who wish to come. We will shield you from oppression and ensure that you are free from tyranny.

In some schools, the very structural integrity of the building itself is questionable at best and many necessary materials such as books and chalk are sorely lacking. Today, the President has passed legislation that will attempt to rectify this matter. Named the “Future Minds” program, the program aims to improve the quality of education for both children and adults with the ambitious goal of removing the mass illiteracy found within over 40% of children. Along with increasing funding for schools across the nation, the President has promised to improve access to higher education as universities across Yemen were, under the Al-Islah government, usually only exclusively available for the higher echelons of society due to the high cost of entry, revealing the nepotism that had been festering in the previous government. Now with this policy being repealed and the universities opened to all who are qualified to attend, it will not take long before Yemen has eradicated the failed education policies of Al-Islah and enshrined quality education as a right to all."

As expected by the President the YSP has agreed to nominating selected members of their party to join the cabinet and aid in the reconstruction of Yemen, in return for their aid the President has promised to make several concessions to the YSP, ranging from the release of any socialists still imprisoned from the days of Al-Islah to furthering nationalization of the economy."

In the largest companies in Yemen, it has been found that productivity has improved by up to 20%, and a whopping 35% increase was seen in the smaller private firms. It seems that across the nation, companies have been working effectively with the new system and projections have shown that the initial rise in productivity is only going to improve, with the optimistic estimate being as high as 45%. With our factories seeing this boom in productivity, it is likely that the economy will see a steady and stable rise. Together with rising worker happiness and job retention, initial sceptics of the plan have been completely silenced, something the President has been happily exploiting in many new speeches, with approval ratings continuing to soar for the government."

 jasmin.73.d:0 "With the nation reformed into a fully fledged democracy, the President announced the start of a “National Review Conference”, intended to hash out any further inefficiencies in the government and bureaucracy. Special attention was given to grievances voiced by the Houthis and Southern aligned groups, as they worried that the nation would be divided between richer states and impoverished and marginalized Zaydi and Southern states. Other hot topics of discussion were ensuring local autonomy for the Governorate of Saada, and political representation for the South to be improved. Now with the conference wrapping up, the President announced the NRC-proposed plan in parliament to merge various local governorates into unified regions, radically streamlining local governance and bureaucracy, while adopting a more federalized system. With most major criticism dealt with, the people are looking forward to an improved and streamlined bureaucracy in place of the often bloated one of the previous decades."

Now following the release of a UN report placing us in the top five best Middle Eastern nations in terms of freedom, human rights and economic development, all the world looks upon us with newfound respect. Our fellow liberal democracies in particular have been highly vocal in their support of us, with our President receiving praise from each member of the Democratic League for having brought peace, democracy and stability to our corner of the world. The Prime Minister of Canada, [CAN.Getleader], in particular stated that “Yemen has become a bastion of freedom in the Middle East, one we are committed to cooperate with now and in future.” With the Al-Islah government now just a distant memory, it has become clear to any who has been paying attention to our progress that we have freed ourselves from tyranny and that we are now ready to stand at the side of the democratic world as an ally of liberty."

 jasmin.75.t:0 "Start of the National Recovery Plan"
 jasmin.75.d:0 "Today the President has announced the establishment of the National Recovery Plan, aiming to begin the reconstruction of the nation's most devastated regions. Across the nation, infrastructure has laid in ruin ever since the end of the civil war with thousands of citizens still lacking access to basic services, such as clean drinking water and in the worst of cases food. Furthermore, the effects of the civil war have also been felt on the housing industry with reports of nearly a million homeless caused by fighting during the civil war. Now with the passing of the National Recovery Plan tens of thousands of workers are headed out to fix our nation's broken infrastructure with teams of workers being sent across the country repairing roads, ports, power lines, homes and water pipes. The President has recognised the importance of these reconstruction efforts and hopes that within the coming years Yemen will at last recover from the deadly effects of the civil war and be on its way to modernisation."

 jasmin.76.t:0 "Urban Rebuilding"
 jasmin.76.d:0 "Today the President has announced the expansion of the National Recovery Plan which has been aimed at speeding up the process of recovery from the civil war. With progress already being seen across the nation, with hundreds of miles of new roads being paved, water-pipes restored and power stations now operational once more, the President has now chosen to increase funding for the Urban branch of the NRP in the hopes of quickening the rate of reconstruction in the major cities. This funding has now been allocated to the expansion of the Urban branch of the NRP, where it is expected that over the coming months an additional twenty-thousand recruits are expected to join the reconstruction efforts aiding in repairing the nation's damaged factories, towns and major cities. With priority being given to the major cities, such as Aden and Sana’a, many have expected these cities to eventually become the bustling economic hubs they once were before the outbreak of the civil war with commerce and trade hopefully passing through these cities once again which will benefit the entire nation in its modernisation efforts."

 jasmin.77.t:0 "Rural Development"
 jasmin.77.d:0 "Today the President has passed further legislation aimed at aiding in the National Recovery Plan's efforts to rebuild the nation following the devastating effects of the civil war. The legislation has established a new branch of the NRP which will devote its efforts entirely to the protection and preservation of rural Yemen. Upon the outbreak of the civil war much of the agricultural sector was abandoned with very little government control over its protection, and whilst legislation has been passed since the end of the civil protecting it as to avoid a famine, the President believes that the establishment of an rural programme will negate the effects of the civil war and ease the burden faced by the most isolated villages across the country. With only three percent of our land being considered arable, the President has placed the preservation of these lands as a top priority for the rural branch of the NRP believing that in time, with the development of these regions, our farms will see a significant boost to their production of cash-crops and other vital produce needed for our nation."

 jasmin.78.t:0 "Start of the Electrification Project"
 jasmin.78.d:0 "The devastation of the civil war left much of Yemen in darkness. Power stations across the nation had shut down, leaving the entire nation to resort to alternative methods of keeping the lights on during the evening. However, following the beginning of the National Recovery Plan, electricity is being restored across the nation as power lines are repaired and power stations reopened. The President has been notified of the flaws of our electrification, as the country has mainly been powered by outdated coal stations for the past decade. In an effort to modernize the nation, a bill has passed in parliament to establish the Electrification Project, an ambitious plan aiming to bring Yemen’s electric grid into the modern age. The project seeks to replace these stations with solar energy and expand our petrol and natural gas industry. Whilst ambitious, many modernizers and reformists praise the plan, and the people are hopeful that they finally will be able to enjoy stable electricity service across the nation."

Highly important for the transport of resources, expanding and maintaining the harbours will be of key importance in modernizing and improving the nation's economy. Arriving at the harbour of Al-Hudaydah, one of our major shipping ports, the President gave a speech to those in attendance. “If we truly wish to ensure economic stability and growth, we must prepare our ports for the exports of Yemeni goods to the world. Ships from all nations will anchor at our shores, and our people will prosper!” However, the President has also announced a secondary objective of this harbor expansion as Yemen’s influential position in the Red Sea makes it possible to exert influence over the shipping lanes and protect our waters, making us even more attractive for foreign vessels."

 jasmin.80.d:0 "As the nation continues to recover from the civil war, it has become apparent that Yemen is seeing an influx in tourism, a previously underwhelming aspect of the Yemeni economy. However, with the recent reform and stabilization of the government, it has been reported that thousands of new tourists are visiting our nation to experience all it has to offer. The island of Socotra in particular, with its unique flora and beautiful beaches, is a highly popular destination, together with the old port of Aden and the ancient Marib Dam. Therefore, it has been decided by the government that a portion of the budget will be spent on advertisements to promote our landmarks and nature, while massively investing in our very own national airway. If successful, then the thousands of new tourists may soon become hundreds of thousands, massively boosting our economy. Now with flights from across the world booked, our nation prepares to welcome its tourists."

All across the nation, mines have been digging deeper and more efficiently thanks to modernised equipment, while finding vast swathes of new ore deposits following an investigation. The discovery of unique rare metal deposits of tantalum and niobium, as well as copper, zinc, cobalt and precious metals such as gold and silver, have caused significant international incentive to invest in the sector. Mining corporations originating from nations such as Canada and India are asking for government approval to build and establish mines across Yemen, wherever there may be profit to be found. The President has agreed to such requests and has announced fresh incentives for mining companies to come to the nation and dig for resources. With international tensions rising, Yemen shall become one of the main suppliers of precious ores to be processed in the production of everyday materials and weaponry, bringing in an untold amount of wealth for our small, yet prosperous, nation."

 jasmin.82.d:0 "The precious liquid of oil has always been one of the few lifelines of our nation, with our main export being petroleum. However, the civil war severely disrupted its production and export. Following our victory, the government focussed on both restarting the petroleum industry and upscaling production. To the luck of our nation, new oil deposits have since then been found and are in the process of being extracted, with rough estimates predicting we hold much larger reserves than previously thought! With this discovery, nations around the world have expressed their interest to once again trade with and invest in us, which will create thousands of new jobs in this now once again booming sector, bringing prosperity to our nation. Alongside the economic benefits of this discovery, we have grown more self-sufficient in fueling and preparing our military in case of any conflicts that will inevitably arise within our region dominated by authoritarian despots."

While the Baathists have outright refused to talk, the leader of the Nasserist Unionist People’s Organization, Abdulmalik Al-Mekhlafi, had agreed to negotiate. This has led to some consternation amongst some of our Jasmine allies and cabinet members, as the Nasserists were our enemies during the civil war. However, Sha'abi has pushed through and formally met his colleague at the presidential palace this afternoon. After hours of negotiations, the two men gave a press conference, in which Mekhlafi once again formally denounced his former ally Saleh and reaffirmed his commitment to Yemeni democracy, announcing his support for Sha'abis government as a chance for social change for the nation. The conference ended with the two men shaking hands, as the political landscape has once again changed."

Since the start of small targeted nationalisation efforts, public opinion polls have begun to shift from the YSP in the favour of the National Front, with voters stating their growing trust and support in Sha'abi’s government. This has upset some of the more radical marxist members of the party, who still see themselves as the true vanguard for socialism in Yemen, and were dissatisfied with the limited scope of nationalisation and efforts of our cabinet. However, this is in contrast to the moderates, who have found themselves allied and working together well with many of our NF party members. The issue has caused widespread debate among the party, growing ever more public and intense, which has caused public support for the YSP to continue to plummet further."

 jasmin.85.d:0 "Today, president Sha'abi has met and had tea with a fellow National Front MP, who has proven himself to be quite popular amongst his colleagues and the people. The MP in question, Muhammad Al-Jadri, worked previously as the president of the General Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions during 1990 and has now successfully been elected in a traditionally very conservative part of the country. His fiery appeals to democratic values and populist leftwing ideals garnered him support among the electorate, and his recent cooperation with National Coalition colleagues for education budget reforms has garnered him much respect from the opposition. As a rising star, Sha'abi has personally thanked him for his work and looked forward to his continued service to the nation."

 jasmin.86.d:0 "When the Nasserist Union entered into a coalition with our ruling National Front, everyone assumed it would remain at that. However, after the approval of limited nationalisation efforts by our government, the two men and their aides have spent many days in further negotiations. Now, both friend and foe are blown away in absolute surprise as a press conference was given, explaining the creation of a United National Front, a fusion party of both the NF and NUPO as a means of uniting leftwing forces in a grand coalition. In effect, both remain nominally independent parties, but will strategically primary and campaign against the opposition in order to empower leftwing control of parliament. President Najeeb al-Sha'abi enthusiastically proclaimed himself head of the UNF, promising further change. While the opposition decries this new unholy union, chief among which the more centrist National Coalition, some Nasserists exclaimed worry for the apparent dominance of the NF in this new party. But Mekhlafi has stated this is the best way for the party to change Yemen for the better."

The leader of the YSP and idealogue for the marxist faction, Ali Salem al Beidh, has uttered scathing criticisms in a late-evening talk show on Sha'abis decision to ally himself with “traitorous rats that spilled Yemeni blood”. The remarks come after rising tensions in the YSP itself, with debates and clashes between marxists and moderates growing more frequent and public. Today, president Sha'abi has offered a rebuttal, stating that his party is committed to Yemeni socialism with a humane face, and the Nasserists have proven themselves natural allies in this process. It is to be seen how relations between the two parties continue to develop."

 jasmin.88.t:0 "Rift Forms in the Socialist Party"
 jasmin.88.d:0 "Ever since elections after our victory in the civil war, the South has been a YSP stronghold. However, in a major local election where a majority of southern seats were up for grabs, the United National Front has booked incredible successes, unseating many YSP aligned MPs from parliament. Reasons for this shocking upset are speculated to be the continuing animosity in the YSP and the great popularity of the UNF itself, together with its strategic focus on primaries and campaigning. This stunning loss has thrown the YSP in complete disarray, with party leaders having called a party congress to discuss matters. Marxists openly called for leaving the coalition and joining the opposition, but many of the more moderate socialists have announced their intent for further cooperation with the UNF. After a ferocious tirade of several high-ranking marxist leaders against their party members, which was secretly filmed and subsequently leaked to the press, many moderates walked out, and a few days later Attas announced the formation of the Democratic Socialist Party of Yemen in direct opposition to the YSP, to great anger of their former colleagues. President Sha'abi later sarcastically remarked that the supposed ‘vanguard of socialism’ had only caused its own downfall."

However, after the votes were counted, it appears over half the seats that were projected to be NC wins actually were won by the UNF by margins of up to 10%. In effect, this has given the UNF control over half of parliament seats with support from the moderate socialists, a clear majority to enact even more audacious reforms through. President Sha'abi and fellow party leaders were ecstatic by the news, giving a press conference exclaiming their joy for this great victory. Not all is good though, as many NC candidates that lost the vote were furious and confused. Gossip and rumours of voting fraud began to circulate, even amongst some UNF members, to explain this surprise victory. But Sha'abi has dissuaded these allegations, stating that the UNF has won fair and square, having been given an absolute mandate by the people of Yemen for their continuing governance."

After much discussion, Attas contacted Sha'abi for negotiations, and after weeks of intense dealmaking, a joint-press conference between the two party leaders was held. Live on camera, Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas announced the fusion of the DSP into the UNF akin to the Nasserist Union, and their commitment to integrating into the wider party structure. Immediately after, protests broke out in several southern cities headed by the YSP, angered at their former colleagues’ betrayal.

However, today the headspeaker for the UNF faction proposed a highly controversial bill, “The Defence of Democracy Act.” Signed by president Sha'abi himself, it cites both global and internal instability as a great cause for concern for the Yemeni nation, possibly tearing it asunder in the sea of conflict that surrounds it. Therefore, the act proposes for the powers of the presidential executive office to be greatly expanded, and election cycles lengthened from 4 to 6 years to maintain stability. Immediately after, members of the National Coalition and Popular Revolution were furious at this “blatantly authoritarian proposal” and announced total opposition to its passing. The YSP similarly denounced it, calling it a total hypocritical sham. Even more surprising and concerning for the UNF fraction though, was the angered tirade of popular UNF politician,Muhammad Al-Jadri, who calls the Act an “attack on the very ideals that we fought for in the revolution”, who together with the opposition proceeded to walk out of the parliamentary session."

As parliament exploded in a ruckus of intense debate, Sha'abi was reportedly furious at this betrayal, but with the full backing of the opposition, the vote needed to go through. The people in the streets were tense as the week went on, the halls of Sanaa filled with intense backroom negotiations, pleadings, threats and offerings. Today the vote is held, the week-long deal-making culminating into this very moment, and as the last vote is made, the Speaker of Parliament announces..."

Immediately after, the Speaker of the House put up the “Defence of Democracy Act'' to a vote, which all remaining MPs overwhelmingly voted into law under loud applause. Later on the evening, president Sha'abi himself declared on national TV a new dawn for Yemeni democracy, and promised to protect and uphold the system with his new powers against “any and all internal and external enemies of the Republic of Yemen'', a claim that was later rejected by Jadri and opposition forces, stating that now nothing stood in the way for Sha'abi for complete power."

Approximately 6 hours after the vote, president Sha'abi announced on national television his immediate resignation as both president and party leader, calling out his former allies as “traitorous snakes'' and announced his immediate retirement from politics. While usually the office would be handed to the vice president, Jadri rallied his allies and forced an inter party vote just three days later, electing Jadri as party leader of the UNF and president of the Republic of Yemen.

While some MPs had broken off and became independents after Sha'abi’s resignation, the major concern after calming remaining NF MPs was the potential falling out between the three member groups of the UNF, when the political deals that were involved in their joining came to light. However, after weeks of intense negotiations, Jadri, Mekhlafi and Attas came to a mutual understanding, reaffirming their ties in the UNF as partners.

Should Yemen offensively use these weapons, striking against its neighbours, we would be responsible for the deaths these weapons caused.

We had assumed that the British would not be so foolish as to think that our government would ever consider bringing intentional harm to another nation's population.

With our reputation of international isolation, we had never anticipated such a strange proposition from such a small nation within the Middle East, and therefore our government was initially hesitant. But the potential economic opportunity this gives us is enough to be considered seriously.

 jasmin.104.d:0 "Today, our ambassador to Japan has confirmed the Japanese approval to establish a new trade deal between our nations. In exchange for access to their advanced electronics market and Japanese investments in our helplessly outdated electronic infrastructure, we have committed ourselves to exporting part of our petroleum to the Japanese port city of Nagasaki. The people of Yemen will now soon have access to technology we had previously never thought would become available to the wider population. As these imports begin to arrive at our ports, dozens of companies have requested access to these technological marvels with new businesses propping up across the country. Whilst the economic benefit of such a deal is obvious and our infrastructure is already seeing massive improvements in quality and efficiency, the deal has also begun to impact our very own culture. With families across the nation now using VHS’ as a pass time, it has become evident that cultural exchange has taken hold of the nation, with aspects of Japanese culture becoming prevalent amongst the youth of the nation."

 jasmin.105.d:0 "Today, our ambassadors from Japan have delivered to us the response of the Japanese government in regards to our request for access to Japanese electronics. Despite the best efforts of our ambassadors, the Japanese government has declined our offer stating that our nation is simply too far away, and lacking in the necessary funds to gain access to the modern Japanese equipment. Even after offering the Japanese government favourable deals for access to Yemeni oil, the Japanese government has refused to change their mind stating that access to oil is not a primary concern of the government at this moment in time soon after ending negotiations with our government. With their refusal, electronic companies will now struggle to modernize their equipment and for many years more Yemen will remain a technological backwater unless new trade partners are found soon."

In return, the Yemeni government has promised to pay us for their soldier’s training. As the most prominent democracy within the Middle East, we would be happy to send our advisors to oversee the training of a potential future ally. However, there are those in parliament who have been vocal in their opposition to sending our generals and military advisors over to Yemen, claiming that the Saudi Arabian government will no doubt attempt to stop our attachés being sent to Yemen as they would see our agreement as open hostility to their government and the beginning of a potential war. However, others in the cabinet argue that whilst the Saudi Arabian government is a corrupt oligarchy who has a rocky relationship at best with the new Yemeni government, they would never risk an outright war over Yemen over such a trivial matter as the training of troops. Following the debate in our cabinet and parliament, our government has given its answer to the Yemeni ambassador."

Despite their opposition believing that the Saudi Arabian government would use this opportunity to spark tensions along the border, the Iranian government has shut down these claims and has backed our nation. With Iranian advisors soon arriving our armies will begin the necessary training they need to become one of the defenders of democracy within the Middle East. As expected, the potential for Saudi intervention was overblown and since the arrival of the Iranian delegates, there has been no activity along the border, leading many to believe that as long as the training takes place away from the border, in the south of our country, then perhaps the Saudis will remain silent on the matter. Now with our troops better prepared to defend ourselves, democracy will be able to hold against the forces of authoritarianism within the Middle East. Perhaps one day the banner of democracy will wave across the entirety of the Middle East, but for now, we shall work on defending it here."

Whilst this claim is preposterous, perhaps their opposition is right. The Saudi Arabian government and our government have never seen eye to eye, and inviting over foreign military advisors to begin training our soldiers may reignite tensions. With this in mind, it may be best for our soldiers to be trained on our own, and thus we should strive to ensure our army is in the fittest condition it can be to defend our nation."

Citing our experience with excavation, the deal will largely focus on the expansion of already existing Yemeni mines and the construction of entirely new ones on recently discovered ore deposits. In exchange for modernising Yemeni mining techniques and the training of local workers, we would gain a favourable share of the profits and output of Australian run mines. However, members of parliament have opposed this deal, citing concerns with sending Australian citizens to a, as of recently, war torn nation and potentially causing environmental damage to the already unstable ecosystem there. After much debate within parliament and internal discussions within the cabinet, we can now answer the ambassador."

Being heralded as a great victory for Yemeni diplomacy, Australian mining companies have already opened discussions with Yemeni companies on how to organise, modernise, and expand mining operations within the nation, while setting up HQs in our capital. Whilst we are still to negotiate the full terms of the agreement, specifically, the percentage of ore dug up and profits gained that the Australian government shall receive, the Australians are now fully committed to aiding our development. With trained Australian miners and organisers expecting to enter the country soon, we shall be sure to see great improvements in this crucial economic sector, while deepening our partnership with our Oceanic friend."
 jasmin.110.o1:0 "We have struck gold with this deal!"
 jasmin.111.t:0 "The Australians Refuse"
 jasmin.111.d:0 "Today our ambassador to Australia has recently informed us that the Australian government has chosen to decline our offer that would have established a mining agreement between our companies and theirs. Having stated the reason for their rejection of the deal to be based on the opposition to the proposal within their parliament, the Australians have backed out from the deal and have refused to discuss the agreement any further. Whilst this is not the outcome we had hoped for, this does allow for more of our mines to be filled with workers from Yemen and does negate the issue of having to give a percentage of our ores away to the Australians. However, even though we will now have undisturbed access to our ores, the lack of guidance from the advanced Australian companies will make it harder for our own companies to modernize and find the resources we desperately need."

The benefits of such a regional union are evident with many seeing it as the first steps towards rekindling unity amongst all Arab nations, as well as granting a significant boost to our economies allowing us to compete internationally.

Cries of 'revisionism' have been heard from the most staunch Marxist-Leninists within the People’s Council.

However, as to ensure that these candidates have no malicious intent, vetting of candidates would remain for the first general election Al-Islah and the General People’s Congress stand in.

Removing some of their more ambitious demands, the YNF have agreed to work with the President and finally put an end to the disruptive behavior plaguing the People’s Congress. While many had expected the President to be lenient towards the YNF, instead, Al-Attas started the meeting by presenting his own demands to the opposition, starting with an immediate end to the staged walkouts in the People’s Council and accepting the current pace of reform. Despite the initial objections from the YNF, all present members eventually agreed that their disruptive practices were doing more harm than good to the nation, while President Al-Attas sweetened the deal by promising a free and fair general election within the next few years. With this acceptance, a temporary alliance was formed by the President and Najeeb Sha’abi, finally restoring order to the beleaguered legislative organ."

With the daily proceedings of the People’s Council now returning to normal, a surprise announcement was made by the General Secretary putting a definite date on the first general election of the People’s Democratic Republic. While the ban on the General People’s Congress and Al-Islah remains, the President has removed the vetting requirement and promised that should the YNF win the election, the YSP would peacefully transfer power. This promise has been widely praised by many across the nation, with the opposition now conceding that the President is truly committed to the return of democracy to the nation, and with some already preparing for the election. However, hardliners within the party have expressed their outrage, claiming that should the YNF win, the revolution would become a footnote in Yemen’s history once more."

The cabinet's division has stemmed from whether or not a new People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen should seek to reunite Yemen as a whole, as was done in 1990 before the Northern rebellion in 1994, or seek to solidify our presence in the south and declare a new southern republic. The first option would bring about the end of the capitalist forces across the nation, allowing for communism to spread itself to a vital corner of Arabia. Furthermore, proponents of such a plan have argued that economically the new PDRY would be strengthened by complete control over the nation. However, others have stated that reunification with the north would overextend the revolution and run the risk of a second northern uprising.

Despite our noble intentions at ending the civil war sooner allowing for less blood to be spilt, there are those who remain within our government who fear that the capitalists of the north will reject our offer and seek to reunite Yemen under their own banner.

Whilst the plan has been met with support, with many pointing to the drastic increase in industrial capacity and population as legitimate reasons to go against our word, others have pointed out these same reasons as to why the north should be abandoned.

Already there have been a multitude of voices within the People’s Council demanding that the National Front be allowed to operate, given that Sha’abi himself is the son of former leader Qahtan Sha’abi. Along with his relation to the former President, Sha’abi also remains committed to the establishment of socialism, with his party branding themselves as 'Democratic Socialists', eager to restore Yemen to its days of glory under the YSP. However, while their support would be beneficial, many are wary of his reformist tendencies, believing that legalising the party would allow for revisionists to establish a foothold in our government and significantly hinder the advancement towards socialism.

While his death has not yet been officially announced to the public, he was killed in a raid by special forces near the end of the war in a rural hideout discovered with aid from foreign intelligence. The newly formed Supreme Court, headed by an apparently non-Communist head judge, will be responsible for bringing these counter revolutionary traitors for their numerous crimes against the Yemeni people. It is very likely that most of the higher-ranking defendants will be sentenced to death, with the rest of the defendants going to prison for the rest of their lives. While this is likely to be criticized as harsh by national and foreign opposition, it is a decision that is unlikely to be changed, for President al-Beidh believes a strong message will be needed to shatter any future counter-revolution."

Within the memo, the president noted that many of the tribes had played a role in the defeat of the revolution in the eighties and nineties, and that these selfsame tribes had fought on the side of the Islamists and Reactionaries during the civil war.

Despite his popularity within the Supreme People’s Council, the General Secretary has already been met with opposition from within the party. With the announcement of the revision of the programme, a moderate wing of the party, led by Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas, has put forward a series of reformist motions in an attempt to challenge the party apparatus and bring fresh debate to the congress.

The moderate wing of the party has argued that there is a clear alternative to ideological orthodoxy, believing that whilst Marxist-Leninism has been successful in consolidating the initial revolution, the time has come to loosen up and permit for more pluralism.

Instead, the moderates have proposed that rather than strengthen the General Secretary, its position should instead be limited in its powers, allowing for a larger emphasis on collective leadership and party democracy, thereby removing the possibility of a cult of personality surrounding the general secretary.

Those who support the General Secretary have declared their support for his motion of fully nationalizing the Yemeni economy, believing that only through full state control of the economy will the nation be able to industrialize at the rate necessary to bring the People’s Democratic Republic into the modern era. However, the moderate faction has once again declared their opposition to the plan, claiming that rushing head-on into nationalization would be detrimental, calling instead for a slower transition permissive of privately-owned businesses.

This will give them full authority to detain suspected counter-revolutionary elements, under the auspices of minister of the interior, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi. However, as expected by many, the moderate wing has risen in opposition to the plan believing that by expanding the police's powers, the party will only create mistrust towards its rule.

More conservative moderates within the party have voiced support for the notion, believing that it would allow for them to operate without risking violating democratic centralism. However, the more radical among the moderates have once again challenged this plan, believing it insufficient and that it is necessary to include multiple parties in the construction of socialism, calling for the political system to be opened up for other, independent political parties.

The second option is the former presidential standard of the People’s Democratic Republic which combines the YSP’s banner, the flag of Yemen and the presidential seal. Many have viewed this option as the best to unite the nation, however, others have criticised the flag as being too authoritarian, contributing to an unintentional cult of personality around the President. The final new option is a recent design known as the Brotherhood flag, this flag combines the flag of the former Northern republic with the star of the YSP which would hopefully unite all in Yemen around the ideals of the party.

 pdy.53.d:0 "Today after weeks of internal debate and voting the Supreme People’s Council has announced the outcome of the first party congress. To the surprise of many, especially the Politburo, General Secretary al-Beidh was unsuccessful in his attempts to retain his position. With the victory of the moderate platform, the General Secretariat is expected to be handed to Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas, leader of the recently established moderate faction of the party. Following this announcement, the new General Secretary addressed the People’s Council, thanking all those who had seen that al-Beidh's political programme was untenable, and would have led to the establishment of totalitarianism. With his moderate wing of the party now firmly in control of the main party apparatus, it has become evident that the manifesto al-Attas had been elected upon will be able to pass, with only limited opposition within the Council, allowing for the establishment of democratic socialism within the People’s Democratic Republic."
 pdy.53.o1:0 "For democracy and socialism!"
 pdy.54.t:0 "The Loyalists Victorious!"
 pdy.54.d:0 "With the end of the first party congress, it has today been announced that Ali Salem al-Beidh has maintained his position as the General Secretary of the People’s Democratic Republic after having won the support of the majority of members of the Supreme People’s Council. Immediately after his victory was announced the General Secretary wasted no time in thanking all those who had supported him and the party's platform throughout the congress. As his speech continued, the General Secretary turned his attention to those who had stood in defiance of the party line, thanking them for the vigorous debate and contributions towards the establishment of socialism, where he then announced his intentions to ensure party unity by ensuring all voices were heard in line with the doctrine of democratic centralism. With al-Beidh’s victory, Marxist-Leninist thought has once more been affirmed, as it has once been decades ago, and with peace now enshrined across the nation it seems unlikely that any time soon the revolution will fail."
 pdy.54.o1:0 "Long live the General Secretary! Long live Marxist-Leninism!"
 pdy.55.t:0 "Protests Against Intelligence Coup"
 pdy.55.d:0 "Towns and cities have today been set ablaze by thousands of protesters, calling for the end of the new government. While many protesters have insisted that their rallies are peaceful, it did not take long for the protests to descend into violence, as law enforcement resolutely engaged the protesters. Across the nation, a state of emergency has been declared, as the government works to put an end to the rioting and to detain the leaders of the protests. In more remote towns, the situation has been reported to be far more severe, as multiple smaller towns have been reportedly overrun by armed rebels, who have now fortified these locations by barricading themselves inside of government offices and turning them into armed fortresses. Until the situation can be resolved, President Zoubaidi has declared that martial law will remain enforced, with the military being given free reign to deal with protesters."

 pdy.56.t:0 "Intelligence Coup in Yemen"
 pdy.56.d:0 "News from the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen has revealed that the government has been ousted following a coup by the nation's intelligence agency. In what has quickly become known as the Intelligence Coup, the new President of the PDRY, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, has stated his intent to preserve Yemeni communism by any means necessary, following the former government's decision to enact major democratic reforms. Having already begun a widespread crackdown against his opponents, it has become increasingly clear that Zoubaidi’s hold over the nation is nearly absolute, with the army having already rallied to his side before the initial coup. With many expecting the continuation of the purges and an expansion of the state’s role over everyday life, in order to preserve the regime and the continuation of communist orthodoxy, the Intelligence Coup has been likened by many to the early days of the East German regime, with many more questioning the links between the Yemeni Intelligence ministry and the German Stasi."

 pdy.57.d:0 "With the rebels having captured large portions of the nation with ease, President Zoubaidi has authorised the use of covert agents with the intent of both gathering intelligence and, if possible, terminating rebel leaders. To the delight of the President, one of these undercover cells has reported back to the government that multiple rebel leaders have been successfully assassinated, following a shoot-out in an abandoned Yemeni Socialist Party office near the Omani border. Apparently, our operatives had convinced two of the largest rebel factions that the others were actually government agents, plotting to assassinate them. When one of our operatives suddenly opened fire on a rebel leader during an important meeting, the other rebels were quick to turn on one another, killing most of the rebels present, including their leadership. Following this report, the President stated that he was not concerned as to whether the government was implicated or not, but that the official line was that the rebellion was disintegrated, as soldiers were dispatched to the site to mop up remaining rebels. With the death of his main opponents, the President has all but secured his control over Yemen."
 pdy.57.o1:0 "We have defeated this rebellion in one swift stroke."
 pdy.58.t:0 "Nationwide Crackdowns"
 pdy.58.d:0 "Following the seizure of various towns and cities by groups of armed rebels, President Zoubaidi deployed the armed forces to destroy the rebel strongholds, overrunning them in one swift, well-orchestrated stroke. Now, in order to ensure that these rebellions will never occur again, the President has now extended the offense to striking suspected hideouts, detaining or terminating anyone located within. With the full might of the Yemeni military being brought to bear, as tank regiments line the streets and armed regiments seize suspected rebel hideouts, the President has declared to the Supreme People's Council that the war against these malcontents shall be finished soon, and that peace will soon be had across Yemen once more. Already, the nationwide crackdown has been efficiently carried out, with raids occurring in the dead of night across the nation, leading to the quick execution of known, and supposed, rebels. As the nation's streets now fall silent with obedience, the President remains convinced that the last vestiges of open rebellion shall be quelled soon."
 pdy.58.o1:0 "This rebellion shall be ended soon."
 pdy.59.t:0 "National Security Council Formed"
 pdy.59.d:0 "With the end of the petty rebellion against the restoration of Socialism in the country, President Al-Zoubaidi has today announced his intentions to further his and the cabinet's control over the country, in order to perpetually safekeep socialism in Yemen. In an announcement to the Supreme People's Council, the President announced that a new government organ would be formed: The National Security Council. Having been met with a fury of applause from within the People's Council, the President continued his speech stating that the National Security Council would consist of leading comrades from across Yemen, endowed with the power to pass legislation and address ‘matters of national importance’ without consulting the legislature, reducing the Supreme People’s Council to not even a rubber stamp. Clearly, the National Security Council is to ensure that power remains solely in the hands of President Al-Zoubaidi, who is to become chairman of this new council, and his immediate cabinet ministers. While the overwhelming majority of the Supreme People's Council heartily endorse this reform, some within the Congress were noted to be lacking in their support. Their names were added to the list."
 pdy.59.o1:0 "The National Security Council shall be the new vanguard of the revolution."
 pdy.60.t:0 "Mandatory Urbanization Program"
 pdy.60.d:0 "Chairman Zoubaidi has today announced the beginning of a new major urbanisation program, intended to grant those from Yemen’s most deserted backgrounds access to higher standards of living, as well as bringing the nation closer together. With the main target of this program being the last vestiges of tribal society, the Chairman has promised to compensate those who willingly accept the program and move to one of the nation’s great cities, with priority access to housing and an initial payment of twenty-thousand rial. Although many have accepted the proposal, now being transferred to the closest town of their former residence, others have refused to cooperate, causing the government to forcibly resettle the tribes from their ancestral land into the larger cities, rescinding the promise of access to priority housing and the initial payment. With the arrival of thousands of new inhabitants to these cities, some have raised concerns over an increased demand for limited water and food supplies. However, the Chairman has ensured that this has been accounted for, with the logistics network of the nation being well prepared to handle the influx."

 pdy.61.t:0 "National Security Council Announces Grand Education Campaign"
 pdy.61.d:0 "In an effort to expand upon the backwards Yemeni education system, the Chairman has today announced the National Security Council’s intentions to embark upon the rapid expansion and funding of schools across the nation. Mainly prioritising primary and secondary schooling, the Chairman seeks to bring an end to the outdated schooling system that often still hinges on decentralised, tribal teaching or religious schools. Furthermore, the Chairman has also announced that this expansion will include reworking of the curriculum, which the Chairman has stated poisons the minds of the youth with ‘revisionist’ and ‘feudalist’ propaganda. Promising to radically alter the curriculum, establishing a proper pioneer organisation for all aged six to fourteen, the new educational system will teach the youth of loyalty to the party and to communism itself, preparing them for the real world, where they shall work arm in arm with their neighbours. With funding already granted, the restructuring is expected to be a tremendous success that will turn the children of Yemen into true communists."
 pdy.61.o1:0 "The new curriculum will bring out the best in our youth."
 pdy.62.t:0 "Shakeup in Command Structure"
 pdy.62.d:0 "Further reforms have today been announced to the Supreme People's Council with the Chairman focusing his attention upon the supposedly outdated and ineffective command structure within the Yemeni military. In an effort to end the alleged indecisiveness amongst generals around battlefield tactics and to improve the training of new soldiers, the Chairman has announced the beginning of the reorganisation of the military, placing himself as the commander in chief of all branches of the Yemeni military. With the plan having already passed unanimously through the National Security Council, all military actions must be granted the full approval of the Chairman before being carried out, immensely restricting the battlefield autonomy of the nation's generals. This reorganisation of the command structure has also had the added benefit of streamlining the training of the military, forcing all to adhere to a strict training regimen, boosting the effectiveness of the army. With this reform, many within the army are hopeful that in time, Yemen’s military shall be on par with the rest of the Arab world, turning it into an elite fighting force."
 pdy.62.o1:0 "The Yemeni army will soon be feared across the world."
 pdy.63.t:0 "Opposition Figures Missing"
 pdy.63.d:0 "From the moment that even the smallest murmurs of discontent within the Yemeni Socialist Party reemerged, the People's Socialist Intelligence Network began gathering names and evidence to convict such oppositionists. Now, with enough evidence gathered to convict all on the charge of subverting the will of the Yemeni people, treason and anti-party behaviour, the Chairman has given the word to the PSIN to carry out the mass arrests of all those opposed to him and his continued rule. With the Supreme People's Council now convening, several key figures were notably absent, including the former leader of the moderate wing of the Yemeni Socialist Party, Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas as well as his supporters. Those absent have already been replaced with fresh faces, supposedly already in line to succeed these numerous retirees. With the arrival of these new politicians to the People's Council, the daily proceedings of the Congress are expected to be more civil, with the Chairman plans now expected to not receive an inkling of opposition."
 pdy.63.o1:0 "A shame these distinguished politicians had to retire so soon."
 pdy.64.t:0 "National Security Council Revises Legislation"
 pdy.64.d:0 "Chairman Aidarus al-Zoubaidi has today announced the reimplementation of several former pieces of legislation initially repealed following his seizure of power. Justifying the decision to repeal universal healthcare and the state welfare system as a temporary measure during the transition, with the intent of pruning them of revisionist influences before their inevitable return. Now after having passed this legislation once more through the National Security Council, purging each policy of bourgeois influence, the policies that were once tools to subvert communism from within have returned with the full authority of the Chairman. With this reimplementation, cheers and praise for Chairman al-Zoubaidi have been heard from all corners of the nation. However, despite the rebranding of these policies, there remains a select few who remember the original implementation of these policies, who remain committed to quietly support the so-called revisionists, despite the best efforts of the Chairman to stamp out their dissent."
 pdy.64.o1:0 "The revisionists were useful to our cause in some ways it would seem."
 pdy.65.t:0 "Transition to Automation"
 pdy.65.d:0 "In a revolutionary speech before the Supreme People’s Council, Chairman Aidarus Al-Zoubaidi has today announced the further restructuring of the Yemeni economy. With the modernisation of the Yemeni economy remaining a prominent focus within the government, the Chairman has now announced that vital industries across the country will be automated, with the government establishing total electronic oversight over large sectors of the economy. Although some have pointed out the near impossibility of the plan, citing an outdated and inefficient electronics sector to handle such widespread implementation, the Chairman has assured those concerned that automation of the economy shall be a gradual process, with trial runs already having been carried out at some enterprises. These resulted in a resounding increase in factory output and highlighted where improvements were necessary, putting many of those opposing the plan at ease. With the process now being adopted by factories across the nation, and an ongoing investigation into the effectiveness of automation, the economy is set to see a significant production spike, with further expansion and tuning of automation already in line for the coming months."

 pdy.66.t:0 "RedStar 3.0 Update Released"
 pdy.66.d:0 "After months in development, the highly anticipated RedStar 3.0 update has been released to the nation. As a new state financed, and mandatory, computer operating system, the newest version of RedStar seeks to improve the ease of browsing the localised network by tracking its usage and coordinating this information to better suit the people’s needs. Other improvements have included the creation of a new web browser, named “Baladi”, that links the user directly to the National Security Council’s homepage, to showcase plans for their local area over the next five years, among numerous other functions. The operating system has already received wide praise from its users, with initial reviews stating that the system is five times faster than previous versions and more accessible for common users. While concerns have been brought up about the extensive censorship, utilising experimental auto-censors to filter data, the state has defended this censorship as protecting the nation from the propaganda and imperialist doctrine of the decadent west. With all systems now supporting RedStar 3.0 the people, and the government, now have access to the fastest operating system in the Middle East."
 pdy.66.o1:0 "A new operating system for a new age."
 pdy.67.t:0 "Operation: False Prophet"
 pdy.67.d:0 "Beginning today, Chairman Aidarus al-Zoubaidi has ordered the commencement of Operation False Prophet, designed to secure the loyalty of imams across the nation, with the ultimate goal of subverting their teachings entirely into becoming a mere extension of Marxism-Leninism. With permission from the Chairman, agents from the PSIN have now begun reaching out to several amenable imams, most quickly aligning themselves with the government. These agents have been given specific instructions by the Chairman to convince the nation’s imams to begin injecting carefully planned doses of Marxist dogma into their sermons as subtly as they can as the first step of the operation. In return for their compliance, the imams have been promised immunity for their past crimes of spreading reactionary ideas and alignment with feudal governments, alongside significant financial rewards. While the operation is largely a success, it has become clear that the more conservative regions of the nation are plagued with imams opposed to our plan, who have rejected our generous offers. With their disappearance, and subsequent replacement, Islam shall become a useful tool to spread the message of Marxism-Leninism."
 pdy.67.o1:0 "The opiate of the masses shall become nothing more than our pawn."
 pdy.68.t:0 "Party Cult Intensifies"
 pdy.68.d:0 "With the purge of the revisionists from the government now complete, the radical shift in Yemeni society that was expected to follow has now come to fruition. Where millions were once loyal to the ideals of revisionism countless more have taken their place and begun to believe in a brighter future, a future led by President al-Zoubaidi and the National Security Council. Across the country it is the party that is viewed as the saviour of the nation, it is the party that has led the revolution into the modern day and it is the party that will one day establish true communism. The once thought desirable ideals of a multi-party democracy have now been abandoned as the population remains ever aware of seditious elements from the revisionists that remain present in the darkest corners of Yemeni society, furthermore the population has accepted that the only ones who can ensure the safety of Yemen and the revolution is the party. Whilst elements of the past still remain, with the President already taking the necessary steps to ensure they are purged from society, it will not be long until the only remaining truth is that the future of the nation belongs with President al-Zoubaidi and the party."
 pdy.68.o1:0 "Yemen belongs to the Party."
 pdy.69.t:0 "Grand Military Parade"
 pdy.69.d:0 "Today, at the behest of Chairman Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, a grand military parade was held along the streets of Aden, demonstrating the size and strength of the brave men and women of the People’s Army, who have dedicated their lives to defending the revolution from all threats, both domestic and foreign. The televised parade began at mid-day, with the Chairman opening the event with a speech praising the military for their decisive and swift action in removing the subversive government and allowing for the revolution to blossom once more. As the day progressed, lines of infantry brigades marched through the city, followed by formations of armoured cars and tanks, all saluted by the Chairman, watching from a stage surrounded by his cabinet and other members of the National Security Council. As the event ended by mid afternoon, all in attendance, and those tuning into the mandatory event from their televisions at home, were instructed to sing the national anthem and dedicate a minute's applause to the brave men and women of the People’s Army."

 pdy.70.d:0 "Since the removal of the revisionists from power, the Chairman has worked tirelessly to ensure that no trace of their existence would be able to re-emerge from the depths of society by establishing an elaborate surveillance network across the entire nation. Every factory, educational facility, and private residence has the full attention of the eyes and ears of the state upon it, to ensure the continued preservation of the revolution. Slowly but surely, the people of Yemen see ever more camera’s appearing in the streets, ever more news articles and television programs about recognizing signs of reactionary thought. Rumours float daily of men and women disappearing without a trace, never to be seen again by their loved ones, yet these too quiet down to whispers, and finally silence. And with the Chairman’s position secured from both internal and external threats, there are none with the ability to challenge the perfected communist state. Now, and forever more."

 pdy.71.t:0 "Listening In"
 pdy.71.d:0 "With the Chairman eager to improve upon the lives of his citizens, routine electrical refurbishment has now been carried out across all homes. Electricians, accompanied by members of the People's Socialist Intelligence Network, began to install brand-new, safer electrical installations across the country. While a routine matter, families were advised to leave their homes during refurbishment, as the technicians would need room work safely. With the vast majority of homes vacated, the improvements began with electricians beginning to unscrew electric paneling and placing within it a small device connected to the building’s power. This device, now active within many homes across the nation, will record and transmit any noise heard within the building to PSIN monitors who remain on the lookout for any signs of rebellion or dissidence. Outside of this routine electrical maintenance, the government has also commissioned an increased number of CCTV cameras along roads and highways, allowing the government to monitor all citizens more effectively. With more houses expected to receive the free electrical upgrade over the coming months, there will soon be very little place for revisionist thought to hide, with every word being monitored by the PSIN."

 pdy.72.d:0 "In an effort to continue the modernisation of the army, further developing its professionalism and loyalty to the revolution, multiple advisors from the German National People’s Army and State Security Services have been invited to observe the People’s Army in action in a simulated battle. From their findings, they would aid in the development of new and more effective tactics and more disciplined training exercises. Following their observations, already several issues have been pointed out by the German generals, specifically about a widespread lack of ideological schooling and a disregard for the military hierarchy. Believing this stems from the civil war, with its localised cellular guerilla structure, the German attaches have proposed a renewed effort in ideological education and strict military discipline, with utmost loyalty to the state and the communist revolution. The attaches also allowed leading Yemeni generals access to NVA documents, detailing the training regimen that all conscripts of the NVA undergo on a near weekly basis. Already, their methods have shown results, with the military now seeing a significant improvement in discipline and effectiveness, standing at the ready to vanquish any would-be reactionary invader."
 pdy.72.o1:0 "The People’s Army will become the shield and sword of Yemen."
 pdy.73.t:0 "Televisions Distributed to the People"
 pdy.73.d:0 "As reward for their loyalty to the revolution, the party and the Chairman himself, the state has distributed new televisions to every household in the country, free of charge. These televisions boast an impressive twenty-five inch screen with high definition display and sound quality, and can be set up with relative ease. With the government promising to replace all old televisions in households for the newest update, households across the nation can now enjoy access to modern television sets, where they will be able to receive broadcasts from the all channels of the recently founded Yemeni Central Television. The government's campaign has proven to be a resounding success, with over ninety-five percent of households now having installed the new televisions. However, unbeknownst to the wider population is the fact that within each television is a small hidden camera, allowing operatives of the People's Socialist Intelligence Network to monitor the activities of citizens in their most private moments. With the cameras small enough to pass for a small circuit, it is unlikely that they shall be detected, and in case of malfunctions, the government is able to quickly and easily detect and replace the defective television."
 pdy.73.o1:0 "No one can hide from the government now."
 pdy.74.t:0 "Mass Disappearances Across the Nation!"
 pdy.74.d:0 "Many within the Supreme People’s Council had originally assumed that the automation of the economy would have ended when the economy had adopted the practice, however, the Chairman has now chosen to automate the People’s Socialist Intelligence Network itself. Having implemented a more streamlined method of data extraction through the use of new facial recognition technology, hooked up to a massive data register, able to quickly connect a face with a database entry. With this implementation, many across the nation have reported the sudden and unexpected disappearance of close relatives and co-workers, who supposedly quit their jobs and were reassigned elsewhere in the country. Others, however, are realising what is happening and have prepared to leave the country. With the automation of the surveillance state, however, it is unlikely these deserters will be able to make their escape. With more and more suspected rebels being rounded up and silently removed from public view, the Chairman can now only watch on as the grip of the PSIN sinks deeper and deeper into the country."

 pdy.75.t:0 "Student Protests in Aden Disrupted"
 pdy.75.d:0 "As dawn broke over the city of Aden, hundreds of students studying at Aden’s university suddenly had their dormitories raided by agents of the People’s Socialist Intelligence Network, after having been discovered to have been planning to carry out large anti-government protests. Among the detainees, there is widespread confusion as to how the intelligence agency was able to determine that the protest was going ahead due to the protesters’ due diligence in keeping quiet about it. Already, many of the students are turning on one another, accusing their compatriots of being government informers. In reality, their assumptions could not be further from the truth, as since the first discussions of the protest the intelligence service has been keeping the students under observation with the extensive surveillance apparatus established in the last few years. The arrest of these rebels before their protest began has been heralded by the PISN as a resounding success, as it has revealed the perfection of the surveillance state, ensuring that the rule of the National Security Council may never again be challenged."
 pdy.75.o1:0 "Never again shall protest fill the streets."
 pdy.76.t:0 "Democratic Parties Legalized"
 pdy.76.d:0 "During the initial phases of the state's reconstruction, it was determined that former members of the Jasmine Council, as well as the parties they operated under, were to be outlawed and shut out from the political processes. This line initially appeared to be upheld at the congress, where the former general secretary argued in favour of keeping the Single-Party state. With the victory of General Secretary al-Attas, it has become increasingly clear that these initial reforms to the state were a mistake, only introduced to strengthen the position of the al-Beidh and the party. If democratic socialism is to be truly implemented in the country, then it is necessary that these bans are overturned, allowing for the formation of a democratic opposition. Effective immediately, all sections of the former Jasmine Council, alongside other groups such as the Nasserist Unionist People’s Organisation and all other parties are to be legalised. However, in order to safeguard our people from the reactionary enemy that began the civil war, the ban on Al-Islah and the General People's Council has been maintained, to ensure the reactionary tyrants may never again subvert the will of the people."

 pdy.77.d:0 "With the Yemeni National Front now being allowed to operate as an independent political entity, an article published in all newspapers across Yemen has stated that the YNF intends to re-establish their national branches. Across various towns and cities, local headquarters of the YNF have reopened, each with its own regional leader. This establishment, whilst completely legal, has sent ripples throughout the Yemeni Socialist Party, with many fearing that a rise in support for the YNF will eventually have them become the second party of the nation. Already, there have been reports of the YNF receiving significant support from remote villages that have flown under the radar since the revolution, who have felt left behind by the rapid progress that has been occurring across much of the nation. Furthermore, many members of the former Jasmine Council have flocked to the reestablished YNF, seeking to restart their political careers within a rapidly growing party."

 pdy.78.d:0 "Today, as promised by the President, the nation will now for the first time choose its leader in the first general election of the People’s Democratic Republic. As expected the Yemeni Socialist Party has been leading continuously in initial polling, with many believing that the President shall maintain his position, riding off of the wave of popularity caused by the reforms he and the YSP have implemented. With a plethora of other smaller socialist parties running against the President, vying for control of the nation, it has become clear that the makeup of the Supreme People’s Council will be drastically different by the election's end. Despite the multitude of parties running, it is the YSP’s main opponent, the Yemeni National Front, who takes prominence, basing their campaign on breaking the YSP’s hegemony and establish a truly democratic socialist nation. Now as the votes have been cast and all ballots counted and totalled, the first general election of the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen has been won by..."

 pdy.79.d:0 "One of the most important goals of the newly reestablished socialist government has been the economic revitalization of Yemen. Basic needs remain lacking within Yemen, and poverty remains an ever present issue. In response to this, the President has laid out plans to the Supreme People's Council that would establish the first four-year Plan, which aims to completely rebuild the war-torn country in four years. Effects of this new plan are already beginning to show, as various new construction projects have commenced and factories and other such industries have also been established. Workers have begun to be redirected to the industrialization effort, with special benefits offered to all the workers who participate in the rebuilding of the nation. While some concerns have been raised that the government is neglecting the rural population with these new developments, and that it could possibly have negative effects on the national agriculture, the people of Yemen have so far shown great support for this plan, believing it will bring economic prosperity and much needed relief."

 pdy.80.t:0 "Construction of the Aden Water Purifier Station"
 pdy.80.d:0 "As one of the first steps of the four-year plan, the construction of the Aden water purification station has now been completed. For years Yemen has suffered from water shortages, affecting much of the rural population and leaving even many within smaller towns and cities without access to clean, running water. With the completion of this purification station, the first out of many, the President hopes that this station shall aid in resolving the crisis and providing clean drinkable water to the nation. Reports have stated that the construction of the new purifier will improve the quality of life in the country’s urban regions, alongside providing clean water to nearby farmers, who have been particularly affected by shortages. As more purifiers are being constructed, other towns and cities are also expected to see a significant improvement in their quality of life, as reports of cholera and typhoid are expected to slowly decrease over time. With this purifier now active and running twenty-four hours a day, it has become clear that the economy is slowly beginning to modernise with the four-year plan exceeding expectations."

 pdy.81.d:0 "The rural communities have long been the backbone of Yemen, providing the country with the basic necessities of civilization. Yet, they have always received the brunt of damage during Yemen’s crises. The countryside still remains damaged from the Civil War, and although fresh water has begun to be restored to these areas, many basic necessities are still lacking. To resolve this, the President has decided to begin the establishment of farming cooperatives, to organize the farmers and to ensure not only that their products reach the rest of the nation, but also to improve the living standards of these communities. With land reform being carried out, the rural population have responded very positively to the creation of these cooperatives, although a few former landowners are of course displeased at this move. At long last, modern agriculture is coming to Yemen, and is sure to benefit us all."

 pdy.82.d:0 "Yemen, like most countries in the third world, currently lacks universal electrical coverage. As part of the 4-year plan, new steps have been taken to electrify the whole nation. The Al-Mansoura Power Station has begun to upgrade its equipment to further increase its electric output. While this will mainly affect the urban areas, the President has made sure to promise to extend the electrical grid to the rural regions of the country, so that electrification may benefit the entire country. This is also expected to help expand the economy, as mechanization of industries shall become widespread, allowing more efficient and smooth production. These efforts have of course come with great support from the people, as Yemen begins to enter a new modern age, with socialism leading it forward."

 pdy.83.d:0 "As part of the renewed economic revitalization of Yemen, a new infrastructure project has been initiated. This project, with the approval of the Supreme People’s Council, aims to connect the coastal regions of Yemen with both rail and road. Yemen currently suffers from a lack of working infrastructure, as it suffered under the civil war. This new project is expected to improve transportation between Yemeni ports, to ease the flow of goods across the country and beyond, benefitting our exports too. The economy is expected to receive quite the boost from this initiative, as it will resolve several logistical bottlenecks hampering economic growth. This project will also help poorer communities that lack any connections with the main economic centers of Yemen, the new infrastructure projects will connect these communities with the national transportation network, allowing them too to enjoy the benefits of Socialism."

Some more hardline members of the Supreme People’s Council have voiced their disapproval over the increased focus on international trade, but they are a minority, as plans to improve opportunities for imports see broad support. The majority opinion is clear, Yemen must engage in trade if it hopes to rebuild and thrive. The Aden Port is expected to create many new jobs, as well as bringing wealth into previously impoverished communities. As trade is returning to Yemen, goods and luxury items will once more reach the Yemeni people, as well as provide a stable source of income for the nation, allowing socialism to have a stable foundation to be built upon."

The new national park will cover the island of Socotra and will ensure the protection of its natural flora and fauna. Some hardliners have voiced grievances over this move, as there were hopes in the minds of some that Socotra could be opened to industrialization and resource extraction.

It is with this knowledge that the Supreme People’s Council has approved the beginning of resource extraction projects, opening mines all across the country. Not only will this new industry provide valuable wealth to the developing nation, but it will also provide many jobs to the recovering population of Yemen. Some have raised concerns about potential environmental impacts from the beginning of these excavations, however the government maintains that to build Socialism in Yemen, there must be suitable wealth backing it. Despite concerns, a majority of the population has offered its support to the initiative due to the wealth and jobs it will bring to the nation, it seems the 4-year plan goes along smoothly."

Seeking to bring the international revolution to a new frontier, there are very few reasons as to why our government would reject their requests. Their entry would grant members of the Warsaw Pact near unfettered access to the Red Sea, a vital location for influencing and potentially controlling world trade. Furthermore, the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen’s access to oil reserves will allow for a significant increase in both the civilian and military production of the Warsaw Pact member states. Whilst there are very few downsides to allowing Yemeni entry into the Warsaw Pact, some have opposed the idea believing that the recent end of the civil war will seek a significant drain on resources of members of the Warsaw Pact as well as the continued training of the People’s Army to ensure the continued stability of their government.

The reasoning behind the rejection of our application has stemmed from the belief that, given the recent end of the civil war, valuable time and effort would have to be spent to ensure that our soldiers are properly trained and equipped to fight off any remaining capitalist forces within our borders. Despite this belief having no basis in reality, delegates from the Warsaw Pact have refused to change their minds leaving us to forge our own destiny within the Middle East rather than join our European brethren in the fight against the last bastions of capitalism.

The plan, uncovered days before the attempted assassination, would have seen the Chairman gunned down by a supposedly disloyal member of his security detail, who had become disillusioned with the course the nation had taken recently. Had this been successful, the Saudi’s hoped that a succession crisis would occur, destabilizing the nation and removing the threat of communism from their border. However, days before their scheduled meeting both the Chairman and the Minister for Finance were informed of the plot and their meeting was rescheduled to another location. The Saudi agent within the army was swiftly arrested, and now awaits further questioning. In response to this attempt on his life, the Chairman has chosen to not retaliate against the Saudi Arabian government, believing that the arrest of their agent and his survival has demonstrated well enough that the People’s Socialist Intelligence Network holds a clear advantage over the Saudis in the ongoing war of information."

This policy, along with placing a significant amount of formerly private businesses such as electricity, water and the railway into government hands, will also open up for a significantly ambitious project of establishing joint ventures with private investors. This policy will aim to establish cooperation between the nation's largest corporations and the government, with the latter being granted shares in these companies, to ensure that corporations are complying with the nations labour laws, as well as allowing for the eventual nationalization, allowing private companies to continue operations. If successful, government economists have predicted that an increase in output by these nationalized corporations is sure to follow, allowing our nation to prioritise our civilian economy and ensure the people can sate their most basic needs."

Already reports have returned from the newly acquired territories about the progress of the naval exercises, which have revealed the poor state of our navy, leading to the President having urged ports to be expanded in Aden and along the coast of the Indian Ocean. Most of the exercises performed have been with our small destroyer fleet, which has managed to prove itself effective at shooting moving targets and with communication to other nearby allied vessels. However, it is yet to be seen as to whether this effectiveness can be translated to live combat. With our claims in the Indian Ocean, there have been very few who have opposed our movements with these waters largely unoccupied except for the few daring pirates who have now been hunted down and arrested by the brave naval officers out at sea. With these naval exercises ongoing, the President is committed to securing the surrounding seas for Yemen so that no capitalist or reactionary may seek to harm Yemen."

Whilst training has been harsh on the many soldiers involved in this operation, the advisors overseeing our training have been impressed with our acclimatization to the harsh conditions of the Middle East and believe that their own army can learn much from the People’s Army. However, despite these compliments the presence of the Warsaw Pact advisors has also revealed the flaws of our military which are now being corrected and, in time, brought up to the same standards of our European comrades. With this training now a continuous process, our own generals and those of the Warsaw Pact remain committed to reforming the People’s Army into an elite force prepared to either defend itself or to bring the revolution to its neighbours."

With the meetings having lasted the majority of the first day of the visit, both the President and General Secretary then were escorted around the streets of Moscow before taking a plane to Leningrad where further negotiations surrounding trade were held. With these meetings concluded, delegates of both the Soviet Union and PDRY were left to finalize the remaining technicalities of the trade deal as both the President and General Secretary departed to once again tour the city of Leningrad before arriving in Pulkovo airport where the President then departed back for Yemen with the knowledge that Soviet-Yemeni relations had been restored."

The deal itself would see the PDRY gain access to our stockpile of sugar as well as medical equipment, and doctors, all three of which we would be happy to hand over to the PDRY in their time of struggle in recovery from the civil war. However, due to their recovery from the civil war, some within our cabinet have noted that their delegates would be unable to offer anything in return outside of an upfront payment for the goods. President [CUB.GetLeader] has, however, already recognised this and has claimed that it is the duty of the Cuban government to aid its friends abroad in the spirit of internationalism. Despite the President’s goodwill, some members of the cabinet remain unconvinced, believing that Yemen should offer alternative payments, such as access to their oil production, which has now caused a rift among the cabinet.

Furthermore, the Cuban government has also agreed to send a small detachment of medical experts to our nation who will help oversee the daily goings on of hospitals and aid in the training of future doctors and nurses. With the first shipments of medical equipment now arriving in our ports, hospitals across the nation have given their thanks to both President [PDY.GetLeader] and President [CUB.GetLeader] for securing a bright future for the people of the nation, one where the people of Yemen can live without fear of preventable illnesses."

This rejection has come as a surprise to many within the Supreme People’s Council, who had previously trusted the Cuban government to never abandon its international allies in their time of need. The reasoning behind this rejection by the Cuban government has stemmed from the lack of material goods we could offer in return, with our offer of a single upfront payment being rejected as too limited for Cuba’s own needs. Whilst the President would have happily exchanged other material goods, such as oil or steel, the Cuban government has refused to continue negotiations and has now left us to find alternative trade partners for our needs."

Similar efforts have been made with the continent's remaining capitalist countries who, initially were reluctant to engage in diplomacy with their supposed rival, were soon just as enthusiastic about establishing new trade relations as their socialist counterparts. With our presence across South America now known to most, if not all, of its governments the President is hopeful that the delegates sent have managed to secure favourable trade relations with the continent and hopes that in time Yemen will be the first port of call for any of these nations who desire cheap oil, weaponry, food or any other kind of material that is needed by the South American people."

Furthermore, as an unexpected sign of goodwill between our two nations, the Centroamerican government has now agreed to send over advisors to aid in our own fruit farms allowing for a similar quality of produce to be created in our own nation now with the aid of Centroamerica in time the people of Yemen will be consuming fresh fruits directly from their local plantation.

Their rejection of this deal has stemmed from their own belief that the cost of shipping exotic fruits to our nation, ensuring they are properly preserved for the journey, would outweigh the benefits of this deal. Whilst the distance between our two nations is great, the President was more than willing to cover half the cost of the preservative measures with the Centro American government, an offer that was still declined.

The Republicans, realising that they could do little to assuage the outraged President, bowed their heads in resignation and departed from the office. The decision was met with outrage among the people, with the report being denounced as a fraud by not just Republicans but independents and media publications too, who are pointing to multiple holes in the report. The Democratic Coalition has been shaken, and nobody is more aware of this than Bill Hammons."

 midwest.8.d:0 "The political chaos gripping the country has developed further, as the one fixture of stability in the Midwest Union too, has been smashed. The Democratic Coalition, long a powerful player in the country, has seen both its Democratic and Republican wings depart the party as scandal after scandal continues to rock it. Nowhere is this felt more than the approval ratings of President Bill Hammons himself, who has seen his support plummet to levels comparable to the late President Ronald Reagan. As the final nails are put in the coffin of the Democratic Coalition, so seems it that Hammons' chances of reelection are growing ever slimmer."

 midwest.9.d:0 "With the departure of the Republicans from the Democratic Coalition, many commentators wondered whether they would go their own way and risk splitting the conservative vote, or join forces with another rightist faction. Today, that answer was resoundingly answered, as Hillary Rodham appeared at a press conference flanked by multiple leading Republicans. She pledged that with the support of the American patriots besides her that American restoration was at hand, a vote for her would be all that is necessary to ‘restore this once great country of ours!’ While Bill Hammons’ office refuses to comment on the matter, insiders have detailed that any sense of cooperation between Bill Hammons and Mark Pryor has broken down, with the two no longer seeing eye to eye on most matters. Nevertheless, this is a big win for Hillary Rodham, who has hitherto been unable to accrue much influence within Denver thanks to the now-gone iron grip of the Democratic Coalition. With this, it looks as if she’s a true contestant for the highest office of the land."

 midwest.10.d:0 "In news surprising to none following the recent political developments in the Midwest Union, President Bill Hammons has suspended his reelection campaign. With the polls indicating that only 4% of the electorate intend to vote for him, President Hammons has dipped below United Midwest candidate General Baker and is widely regarded as no longer being a viable candidate. This news indicates a tightening of the race in favour of frontrunner Hillary Rodham, as well as the undetermined Democratic nominee, widely expected to be Bill Clinton who has been leading in both delegate and grassroots support for some time. Commenting on Presidents decision, Hillary Rodham said that ‘Hammons saw that his campaign was untenable and did the honorable thing and suspended it’. The few remaining Coalition supporters have expressed disappointment, but there appears to be little appetite for running a replacement candidate. With that, Hammons presidency appears to be much like that of his predecessor’s, a one-term affair."

Clinton, sixty-four years old, is widely popular amongst party members although many within and without the party are questioning the wisdom of nominating an aging candidate whose roots in the Union go back to its founding. This, however, didn’t seem to bother the party delegates, who as expected nominated the candidate almost unanimously in a grand ceremony in the downtown Colorado Convention Center. Now, the Democratic Party is gearing up to a full election campaign, with the President out of the way and ready to take on Hillary Rodham with a candidate of their own. Already, the polls are indicating dead heat between the two, and the 2010 election is shaping up to be one of the most interesting ones since the formation of the country."

 midwest.12.d:0 "The first debate of the election has come to a close, as only two of the parties reached the necessary fifteen percent polling requirement to attend the debate was centered around the two major candidates: Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton. The debate was a sober and issues-oriented one, with the two candidates both wanting to put an end to the anarchy plaguing the Union and reaffirm the power of the central government, although they differed greatly on the methods which should be used, with Rodham advocating more hardline policies to bring the frontier in line, in contrast to Clinton’s reconciliation based approach. The matter of inter-American politics also reared its head, with the candidates discussing recent political developments in the UAPR, the Republic and the People’s Commonwealth, before reaffirming their wish to reunite the former United States of America under democratic governance. Of amusing note to many viewers, the two candidates were once married, with the debate still carrying a streak of tension from their divorce decades past. While Hillary Rodham had hitherto been regarded as a frontrunner in the race, Clinton’s strong performance seems to have given him a boost in support, with some polls even putting him in the lead. The absence of any other candidate is felt, as the race seems to ever more become a matter of Rodham versus Clinton."

As Hammons still controls the civil service and state department, figures within the Wichita Unity Party have been calling upon city native and prominent Midwestern businessman David Koch to do what must be done, and suspend elections to protect the Midwest from power-hungry zealots. Koch ally Mike Pompeo has notified the businessman, famously reclusive since the death of his brother Charles in the Atlantic Cruise Incident, that the state department has already been secured by the "business plotters". Hammons, Pompeo writes, remains completely oblivious to the moves of his own party. The question of what to do with this clear infiltration of the party and government by his loyalists has been left to David Koch himself - will the blessings of liberty be secured through bold action, or will the coup dissipate as if nothing ever happened?"

The two candidates themselves have campaigned hard for the average midwesterners’ vote, with Bill Clinton stopping in Pueblo late last night to shake hands and talk with locals, and Hillary Rodham stopping in the small town of Salina, Kansas to meet with farming representatives. This election coincides with a tense time for our union, with reports of political violence already coming in from polling places around the country.

In Denver today, at 10:30 AM, Clark travelled to the Capitol Building to meet privately with President Hammons in his office. There, he revealed a hefty dossier filled with compromising information regarding the Democratic Party. It turns out that Clark himself was targeted by the Democrats, attempting to recruit him to sabotage the Unity Party coalition government. With an elder statesman like Clark on their side, the Democrats could easily hold an unbreakable grip on political power in the Midwest. As Clark left the office, he left behind a bewildered Hammons, now afraid that no one in his inner circle could be safe from targeting by his rivals."

 midwest.16.d:0 "Today, the President has ordered the dismissal of Vice President Mark Pryor. As General Clark’s findings continue to rock national politics, Bill Hammons has decided to take action against the Democrats; especially those in his executive branch. Pryor had been known for working well between Unity and Democrat party lines, which had gotten him that job earlier in the Hammons Administration. However, as the Unity Party severed itself from the Democrats, Pryor had to be cut loose as well. Democrat legislators spoke outside the capitol to various reporters, pointing out that the President had flagrantly broken the constitution, with some demanding his resignation. One thing is for sure, political disunity has become much, much worse because of today’s event, with many fearing for the future of the nation."

William Jefferson Clinton, the unofficial leader of the Democratic caucus within the Democratic Coalition, has urged all liberal members of the government to follow in the Democratic leaders' examples, and reject the Unity Party and especially President Bill Hammons. The vice presidency, a position traditionally occupied by those of the political center but still of a caucus opposed to that of the President within the Coalition, Democrats argue, is now occupied by a stooge loyal only to President Hammons. Republicans, too, are unhappy, as they hoped for a centrist Republican of their own ranks to secure the second most powerful body in the Union."

The Democratic leadership responded worriedly to this response, with some even fearing that Clark would alert Bill Hammons, given the close relations between the two. The Democratic plot has definitely been hit by a setback, with the leadership scrambling to find a new way forward before Clark’s vengeance hits them."

Hammons was shaken by this news, and yet he could not help but to trust the former President, ending the call with a thanks as he had to make the toughest decision of his presidency yet. He could not trust his cabinet, and yet some part of him wondered if Clark was just playing him for a fool."

With little to no warning, most ministries now stand without leadership, as the discharged cabinet members pack up their belongings and depart. This was ill-received by the populace, as Hammons’ cabinet purge appeared random and arbitrary, with some liberal commentators describing it as ‘a simple power grab, reminiscent of the Republican dictatorship in the American Republic’. Hammons, however, stands by his decision and in a press release underlines his accusations that the Democrats were out to undermine him. With this simple move, Hammons has effectively managed to alienate a large wing of the Democratic Coalition that has hitherto governed the country, and many wonder what fate shall befall the Coalition."

With the Democratic Coalition still holding, however tentatively, and the desire for stable governance, the Midwestern Congress has approved many of his replacements, all from either the Unity Party or the Republican Party. The latest nominee, however, seems to have raised a lot of eyebrows across the country. Eric Bodenstab, a longtime personal friend of Hammons and a prominent member of the Unity Party, was nominated the stead of the deposed Pryor, despite little prior political experience. This caused uproar throughout society, feeding the impression that a desperate Hammons is doing all he can to maintain his grip on power, staffing his administration with supporters and cronies. This decision has already been criticised by Democratic leader Bill Clinton, who made thinly veiled comparisons to the regime of former President Bush in the American Republic, but it seems that Hammons has just barely enough political capital to push his nominee through Congress, at the cost of much of his remaining support. Now, Hammons’s power is secure, but his throne is one of sand. "

Now, it appears that not just Democrats but also the Republican Party, who so far have yet to cause a ruckus in the Democratic Coalition, are moving against Hammons, or so the rumour on the streets goes. While no concrete evidence has presented itself yet of any subterfuge, Bill Hammons is growing worried that his days in the high office may be coming to a close, as his secret meetings with Vice President Eric Bodenstab grow ever more frequent, and as his rating in the polls continues to drop precipitously.

With most matters of day-to-day government handled by his Vice President Eric Bodenstab, most of Hammons’ recent public appearances have been press conferences where the President, showing obvious symptoms of insomnia, rambles in length about ‘attempts by subversive elements to subvert our democracy’ and calls for ‘all true patriots’, in particular his own colleagues of the Unity Party, to ‘step up against those who would do our great nation harm’. While few politicians have so far offered comments on the matter, members of both the Republican and Democratic parties have increasingly distanced themselves from the Unity Party in action, voting against the whip ever more frequently in Congress. Hammons’ office seems to have paid little mind to this, as the behaviour of the president grows ever more erratic."

During a normal meeting in the executive, which had by now gotten into a routine of Bill Hammons flinging accusations at his coalition partners with little pause, it became too much. In what appeared to be a carefully choreographed motion, his entire staff rose from the table at once, Democrats and Republicans alike, and simply left the meeting without a word to be said. Bill Hammons was confused by this turn of events, first demanding for them to come back, then pleading with them when he realised that he had probably lost them for good. With their departure, the Democratic and Republican parties soon followed, with both parties declaring that the Democratic Coalition was now unsalvageable, and that the President is no longer fit for the office."

In light of the recent walkout of his advisors, the Democrats have now accused Hammons of being unfit for the office of President, and have gone as far as to draw up articles of impeachment against both him and his Vice President Eric Bodenstab. This significant move has seen a mixed reception outside the Democratic Party, with the Republicans tersely acknowledging the articles while being criticised by even Hammons-critical Unity Party members. With Hammons withdrawing ever more inwards, there seems to be little effort from the president to halt the motion. The Democrats do not hold a majority in Congress, however, and must win over the Republicans, who are generally reluctant about the motion and would rather wait out the rest of Hammons’ presidency.

As Vice President Eric Bodenstab was impeached alongside the President, the presidency now falls to the Speaker of the House, the Democrat Mark Udall of Colorado. Udall is a noted liberal and an environmentalist. Already, some Republican dissenters are criticising the decision to impeach, having preferred for only Hammons to be impeached at most and for Bodenstab to take over as caretaker president until the elections later this year. Nevertheless, Udall has pledged to bring the country back together, restore sensible government and fix the mistakes of the Hammons Presidency."

With the Republican leadership remaining supportive of impeachment, however, the party seems close to tearing itself apart. Already, many dissident Republicans have jumped ship to the Isolationist Party, which was always critical of impeachment, doubling its Congressional Representation already with many more defections expected in the coming days and weeks. The Republican leadership has rushed to stem the bleeding, but seeming stooges of the Democratic Party and its recent seizure of power, they have had little luck. Now, with the Isolationist Party in rapid growth and the Unity Party increasingly courted by the Isolationists, it seems that Democratic dominance may not be as certain any longer."

Now, with the votes of the Isolationist Party, a unanimous and vengeful Unity Party and even a handful of remaining Republicans, Isolationist Tom Tancredo has been elected as Speaker. Tancredo, a right-wing hardliner from Colorado, has pledged to vigorously oppose the ‘radical Chomskyist’ agenda of Mark Udall and to stand up for ‘true American values’ in his function as Speaker of the House. While the President has stated that he’s ready and willing to work together with the Speaker, many other democrats are worried by his ties with right-radical militias, and fear that the current congressional situation will only worsen with Tancredo as the speaker."

This divide has gone straight down the middle, deadlocking Congress and causing many of Udall’s policies to get shot down; he barely even has a full cabinet yet. Nobody could have predicted the outcome, however: what was supposed to be another day of deadlock was interrupted when, on Speaker Tom Tancredo’s invitation, the Congressional Building was flooded by heavily armed right-wing militias, seemingly just being let in by Capitol Police. Tancredo was prepared, having already drafted a Motion of Impeachment towards President Udall. The motion was passed at literal gunpoint, as Democrats and Hope Partyists were threatened to vote in favour or pay the highest price. A couple of Congress members stood their ground, and were removed from the chamber in response. As Udall’s government is quickly and effectively ousted, it now stands to Tancredo who should be nominated as VP and thus be made acting president."

To the chagrin of the Democrats, Bill Hammons’ Presidency has been preserved. This caused little action by the President, still deep in isolation with only Eric Bodenstab as the link between the President and the rest of the world, with Bodenstab trying his absolute best to just keep the ship that is the Midwest Union going.

Impromptu alliances have formed between Vice President Eric Bodenstab and a number of politicians from multiple parties, yet these are not enough to turn the tide, as congressional infighting festers evermore. Bill Hammons is heard from on only a select few occasions, speaking through his Vice President, barely with anything more to say than weak and weary pleas for unity. Deadlock has had terrible consequences for the Midwest Union, as appropriations have shut down completely and officials’ paychecks arrive only with ever-increasing difficulty.

Without much opposition in the streets, the army had captured the capitol by nine o’clock, where General Sidney McChrystal spoke on the steps of the building.

This situation has many people within the Democratic Coalition questioning the ability of the administration to mount an adequate response to prevent a crisis. Within the cities, members of the Unity Party have openly challenged government policy. Most notably, David Koch, once thought to be a party of Hammons’ inner circle, suggested that the government organize a commission to investigate government misconduct relating to this matter and “pursue a different approach in the name of stability”, in a speech given outside his Wichita home earlier today.

The second step is to exploit the turmoil surrounding the election process to centralize intelligence and defense agencies and government departments, to forge a state department loyal to Hammons.

In an event that is being compared to the monumetal debates of Lincoln and Douglas, Rubio of Florida, a staunch American Restorationist and loyalist of Hillary Rodham, espoused his desire for a quick and speedy American unification to restore conservative democracy, while Christie of New Jersey, the heir of a moderate republican tradition, defended the Democratic Coalition and Hammons from Rubio's persistent attacks. Rubio's attacks on Christie focused on his disdain for Bill Hammons, who he claims Christie as a member of the Democratic Coalition is enabling and allowing to "make the Midwest Union more like the rest of the world". Criticizing communist interference in the government, of which he believes Democratic Party members like Mark Pryor and Bill Clinton are enabling, Rubio called for speedy unification and militant anti-extremism, especially when referring to the UAPR. Christie, on the other hand, espoused a more agrarian, rural, localist position. He defended the decentralization of Hammons, and criticized Rubio for continually focusing on the shortcomings of the President while ignoring the flaws of his party's own long-time stalwart, Hillary Rodham."

 midwest.41.t:0 "Isolationist Party Leadership Spill"
 midwest.41.d:0 "Following the resignation of long-time party stalwart Pat Buchanan, who took over the reigns of the Isolationist Party from the radical Merlin Miller, three young and divisive conservative politicians have arisen to secure Buchanan's legacy. The most overtly pro-Buchanan is Catholic traditionalist, anti-immigration activist, and paleoconservative Paul Gosar of Wyoming. Gosar has expressed the need for a more radically Christian alternative to more secular nationalist politicians, along with a "no-compromise" style of governance for the Isolationist Party, rejecting coalitions with the Republicans or the American Restorationists, largely defunct since their loss to Bill Clinton in 2011. The second major candidate is Isolationist house leader Tom Tancredo, known for decades of experience within the political world promoting paleoconservative beliefs. Tancredo, a fervent isolationist and anti-immigrant politician, seeks to bring the party back to its roots as a party opposed to the unification of America and emblematic of right-wing frontier spirits. The third candidate is Kris Kobach, who although radical in his own right, has never truly labeled himself as a paleoconservative. Focusing on immigration but also economic arguments for tax cuts, defense of the capitalist system, and anti-communism, Kobach is the most reasonable choice for those that would seek a coalition with Republicans."

William Clinton has relieved himself from most party operations, the first candidate of the Democratic Coalition to lose an election since the founding of the Union itself. As Clinton makes his disgraceful exit, three candidates have arisen to carry on his mantle. Former Speaker of the House Mark Udall comes from a long-time Western political family with ties to the old Democratic Coalition elite, and his commitment to liberal values could never be understated. However, many find Udall old, lethargic, and too much of a patrician to guide the American frontier. Such opponents have rallied around two politicians relatively unknown outside of Colorado - Michael Bennet and Jared Polis. Bennet, an old American Democrat, supports pro-business policies with clear endorsements for social liberalism, while Polis focuses more on left-libertarianism, criticizing the Rodham government for violating civil liberties and betraying the will of the Midwestern people."

The first candidate is well-known among American Restorationist circles, a former Representative himself - Marco Rubio. Described as an emigré from the Republic's stronghold in Florida, Rubio has expressed the need for Republicans to serve as a bold reminder of America's future, and stand for a quick and potent unification process across the country. More localist and decentralized Midwesterners may empathize more with Chris Christie, an old Republican whose legendary debates with Rubio attracted hundreds of thousands to their televisions. A more fiscal conservative candidate, Sam Brownback, has also made waves for his radical proposals to cut taxes across the board, restoring economic liberty and opportunity to the entire nation in the proces."

 midwest.44.d:0 "The Unity Party was thought to be dead following the collapse of the Hammons administration and rise of Hillary Rodham, the first President of the Union not from the Democratic Coalition in history. Three candidates have risen - one a dedicated Hammons loyalist, the other a Clark loyalist with a long history in defense positions, and the other a businessman and former mayor of Denver. The Hammons loyalist candidate is Eric Bodenstab, Hammons' former Chief of Staff with little political experience to his own name. A supporter of centrism above all, Bodenstab is inoffensive, but is hardly loved by anyone in the Union, his campaign reeling from Hammons' low approval. The Clark loyalist is Chuck Hagel, a devoted centrist who aided the Midwest's military in the conquests of the Rodham administration, even if he could only do so from the sidelines. A democratic stalwart, military mind, and career politician, Hagel is unpopular, but enjoys much support from the party elite. The last candidate is eccentric businessman John Hickenlooper. A moderate liberal who joined the Unity Party in Colorado when he served as Mayor of Denver, Hickenlooper has promoted traditional socially liberal and fiscally conservative centrism to appeal to the Democratic Party."

In addition, Koch has surprisingly rejected the decentralization of Hammons, advocating for further centralization in accordance with the move to Wichita. Koch's new libertarian administration includes former Democratic Coalition Republicans like Sam Brownback, a prominent proponent of Koch's economic theories, along with apolitical capitalists like Mike Pompeo and even radical, progressive libertarians like Nicholas Sarwark.

[Root.GetLeader]'s radical policies of centralization of the Union, the end of the agrarian, libertarian anarchy that has taken hold of the country during the Hammons era, and increased international legitimacy efforts for American re-unifiation mark a turn away from anarchy and a pivot toward strong, internationalist rule."

His nationalist, paleoconservative agenda and controversial statements many interpret to be in support of Christian supremacy and white nationalism, have angered liberals in the Union to the core, and among the government exists much fear and apprehension over a counter-coup.

David Koch, a reclusive politician and businessman whose brother perished in the Atlantic Cruise, has seized the capital and has suspended the controversial 2011 Elections, which saw two centralizers pitted against each other. Koch, a noted libertarian with ties to both nationalist conservative and socially liberal movements, was one of Hammons' most prominent economic advisors. Although his proposals to mend the anarchy through economic development largely failed due to the inaction of the Coalition, international observers expect Koch to continue such projects on much broader levels, and transform the Midwest back into a unifying force.\n\nKoch has already filled his government with figures interested in a military re-unification of the United States such as Mike Pompeo, one of his most critical Kansan allies.

Clark's administration, one filled with generals and former Democratic Coalition members, looks to be surprisingly liberal for a nationalist Junta, leading international observers to place upon him the title of "the American Napoleon".\n\nIt is uncertain whether Clark's merger of liberal social and economic policies with an authoritarian, nationalist, and unification-hungry America will result in glory or collapse, but regardless, one thing is certain - the Midwest is no longer the laughingstock of global capitalism, but a force to be feared."

 montana.1.d:0 "During one of his traditional adresses to the people of Montana, Harold Covington suffered a stroke, with audio and television recording abruptly shut off as the aging, obese leader of Montana was driven to Great Falls' premier hospital. Although Covington recovered soon after and any fears of a post-death power struggle were largely alleviated, the issue of the long-time leader's sucession plans has entered the political stage for the first time in generations. Louis Beam, a loyalist to Covington percieved as closely aligned with the nation's large-scale militia movement, took over much of Covington's administrative duties during the scare, including the direction of the nation's cabinet and the Congress of the White Freedom Alliance. Many, however, including those on the far-right of the White Freedom Alliance, have taken the opportunity to attack Covington and Beam, with many citing dissents similar to that of Spencer in Lincoln. The stroke has given the people and the WFA the resolve to question Covington's rule following the disastrous Lincoln Rebellion, and the much-maligned Covington may yet see a radical shake-up in his own government, whether willing or not."

The constituent organizations in the Alliance, however, are unlikely to fully agree on a candidate, with many in the party congress directly opposed to his leadership, especially during the war against breakaway forces led by Richard Spencer. Aryan Nations, who made up the bulk of the coalition, along with Harold Covington's loyalists, has rejected Covington's favored successor, Louis Beam. Instead, they promote either compromise candidate Matthew Shea, who still maintains a national socialist platform of racial holy war, but has expressed a desire to unite the far-right against godless Spencerites and communists, or Morris Gulett, a radical promising to embrace Aryan Nations' late leader Richard Butler's philosophy of white supremacist theocracy, but unlike Shea, directly challenge the militias and Covingtonites. Beam's faction of loyalists have been so marginalized by the recent events in Lincoln that they will need to secure backing from Shea's faction, but if Aryan Nations can also secure it, they too can go through with their plans to nominate Gulett and challenge Covington from the right. Shea, however, could also use his staggering influence to get either faction to support him against the "greater evil", and proceed with his own radical, totalitarian agenda.\n\nThere is, however an elephant in the room - John Trochmann and his Militia of Montana, which serves as the main paramilitary militia organization in support of Harold Covington.

In an unusual move for Korean leaders, Kim Jong-un has given a televised speech, promising more political freedoms to the people. While liberalization of the regime is expected, it’s unclear to what extent this will happen and how it will shape the future of the Korean peninsula."

 news.311.d:0 "The People’s Junta for the Restoration of Korean Socialism has taken over the DPRK after a power vacuum appeared with the apparent death of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. This junta, spearheaded by four-star general Hyon Yong-chol, appears to be committed to the principles of orthodox Marxism-Leninism and opposed to the Juche ideology that the Kim dynasty has upheld ever since its development in 1955. The entire Kim dynasty and various members of the Politburo have already disappeared and presumably been executed. Meanwhile, the liberalization of the cultural sector fostered by the late Kim Jong-il appears to have come to an end, as Korean artists have been presented with an ultimatum to openly endorse the new military regime or have their careers destroyed. International observers fear that this will have a catastrophic effect on Korean society and the economy, and will most likely inflame tensions in Asia."

While Duke may be the President, the people of America and the world have recognized that true authority over the policies of America continues to lie with the military junta and its leader Mark Milley. Having only restored Duke as a way to increase their legitimacy, the junta still maintains total and complete control over domestic and foreign policy and Duke can offer little opposition to this power-sharing agreement. Officially Duke’s role has been reduced to nothing more than a yes-man for the military junta, acting as nothing more than a rubber-stamp for them and their militarist policies. Begrudgingly, both the Warsaw Pact and the Democratic League have chosen to recognize this new America, even if the two agree that its government is nothing more than a pawn of the army. With the junta enforcing its law across all of America, and David Duke now restored as its President, the future of America looks bleak once more."

The President informed his corporate allies that, once the allocation had been completed, they would have first pickings on the most prosperous mining regions and oil deposits across America. President Duke’s new economic policies have been felt nationwide with the average workers working hours increasing and their pay rapidly declining. With America’s transition towards corporatism nearly finalised, members of both the Warsaw Pact and Democratic League have reluctantly recognized the new America. Despite this recognition the Warsaw Pact has continued its hostility towards America, denouncing it as the amalgamation of pure capitalist thought and as a state that has abandoned its workers all in the pursuit of profit. Likewise, the Democratic League has also denounced the new America citing that despite its hatred of communism, friendly relations cannot be established with a nation controlled by fascists. Now with Duke guiding the hand of the market and ruling with an iron fist, America’s future looks bleak."

With Chomsky gone, the state has now become the leading apparatus of the law enforcing the doctrine of authoritarian socialism, centralizing the economy and expanding police presence across the many states of America.

However, while members of the Warsaw Pact have also chosen to recognize the new nation, there still exists a degree of tension between the Warsaw Pact and [NEA.Getleader]’s America.

With promises of land reform already on the way, the future of Yemen remains unclear with many believing that the present coalition will not last and that, inevitably, the coalition will collapse in on itself due to the vast political differences held between its member factions. Internationally, the victory has been met with limited support, with many viewing Saleh as an unstable despot willing to play all sides to ensure he maintains his power.

Saleh, and his Houthi and Nasserist allies, now face the daunting task of rebuilding the north and preparing for the potential continuation of the war with the south in the near future. Despite the supposed unity of Saleh’s coalition, many believe that the vast ideological differences will bring an end to the alliance and spell doom for the new republic. Internationally, Saleh’s victory has been met with limited support and the acceptance of peace with the south has led many to doubt his leadership.

With the population having turned against the Al-Islah government in recent years, many had expected the civil war to be the end of Al-Islah and the rebirth of Yemen under one of the many factions that had risen up against the government. However, against all odds, the government has maintained control over Yemen and has now begun to solidify its grasp once more over the nation through the arrest of all leading officials of the General People’s Congress, Jasmine Council and People’s Democratic Republic. In a rare moment of clarity from President Qahtan, the government has announced that following the trials of captured leaders and the solidification of control over the nation, Al-Islah, including its various factions, will hold an internal convention to determine the future of the nation.

Yet many Yemenis amongst the public and those in the Islah party itself call for immediate preparations for future reunification efforts, denouncing Qahtans leadership. To remedy this internal strife, the government has announced that following the trials of captured leaders and the solidification of control over the nation, Al-Islah, including its various factions, will hold an internal convention to determine the future of the nation.

Beidh is relieved to finally have regained liberation and peace for South Yemen, stating that “no more shall the fair people of southern Yemen be subjugated by reactionaries and oppressors. We shall chart our own course and take the reins of our own destiny, with or without the North.” Now he and his government stand before a monumental task of rebuilding the nation, but the PDRY can already count on an outpouring of support from Warsaw Pact nations, particularly from the DDR.
