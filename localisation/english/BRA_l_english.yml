idea_bra_terrorist_menace: "Terrorist Menace"
idea_bra_terrorist_menace_desc: "Although instances of terrorism from both extremes have died down since the military dictatorship, several armed groups remain in operation throughout Brazil's sprawling urban centers and poorer rural regions, taking advantage of societal ills and general discontent to widen support for their radical views. While their activities are not halted and deeper sociopolitical issues remain unaddressed, assassinations, kidnappings and bombings will continue being a recurring part and parcel of life in Brazil."
idea_bra_disorder_and_regression: "Disorder and Regression"
idea_bra_disorder_and_regression_desc: "Sky-high rates of crime, endemic corruption, extreme social inequality and other similar issues are all symptoms of a general state of malaise that has gripped Brazilian society since the dawn of the New Republic, which is now going through the motions of a crippling economic crisis. This slump came as a result of a failed attempt at an UBI program that led to a sharp increase in inflation and a major downturn in Brazil’s economy. As long as the myriad of issues plaguing the country are not mitigated or solved, any semblance of stability is fated to fall apart."
idea_bra_politically_involved_military: "Politically Involved Military"
idea_bra_politically_involved_military_desc: "The 1987 transfer of power from the hardline military junta to civilian rule was never consensual. While some in the upper echelons of the Armed Forces follow reformist ideals or even participated in the New Day Revolution, the vast majority of generals and many of the rank and file are nostalgic for nationalist, authoritarian rule. Consequently, the Brazilian military is vindictive against the, in their view, weak, corrupt, and potentially subversive liberal and leftist politicians who replaced them."
